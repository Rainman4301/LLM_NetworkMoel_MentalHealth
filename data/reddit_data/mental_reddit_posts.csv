1l8mxo7,mentalhealth,"Self isolating, with no hobbies","Hello peoples,

So I've been lurking in this sub for a while. I never interacted with the peoples here, or make a post myself, I don't really know why.

I just, need to get it off my chest, to write about my life somewhere.

I'm a 27f, I still live with my parents (a thing I am deeply ashamed off).
I have a job, kinda shitty (customer service).

And that's it I think. I have no hobbies, I do not do anything with my life.
I wake up, prepare to work, go through work, go home, scroll on my phone, and sleep.

I used to have passions, like reading, gaming, or writing.

But I don't do those anymore, it's been years, and I don't really know why.

I'm just, existing, drifting through existence, I feel like a fruit who is slowly rotting on the inside.

I tend to binge on food at night also. It make me feel less empty. Althought it's making me gain weight. But I can't stop myself.
I feel really sorry for my parents and family.

All off that is really dramatic I'm sorry, I guess I'm just looking for peoples acknowledging what I'm going through ? I don't even know if I'm going through something, this is just life for me I think.
Thank you for reading.

i don’t blame my therapist for my own lack of accountability and progress especially because i understand that i can be stubborn but i also feel like i need someone more structured potentially? 

i’m potentially beginning spravato soon and like other meds i’ve heard it can aid the process but ultimately you have to do the work. part of my issue is that im aware of my problems- unwillingness to take action/change but without the structure i feel clueless as to where to even begin. its very overwhelming because i have so many things in life im lacking on / struggling with.

i have MDD, anxiety, ocd traits, ednos

i know that opposite action is a dbt tool and im interested in trying to focus on that. but im unsure of dbt as a whole. i don’t think im interested in cbt. im curious about emdr especially with the context of rewiring neural pathways that seems to have similar language to spravato treatment, but i also don’t particularly have “big T trauma” which i feel like emdr usually addresses from my understanding, also curious about somatic therapy or IFS but i truly just don’t know where to go from here and would love any input/ opinions ",2025-06-11 07:41:32,1,0,fairytoezz,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1l8mo5x/what_type_of_therapist_to_seek/,False,Advice Wanted,

1l8kv2c,socialanxiety,I wanted to believe that people outgrow this kind of thing.,"Here is a story of social anxiety in the workplace. For context, I am an average-looking, middle-aged white female. I am married with two kids. I do not take medication for anxiety, although I sometimes manage it with CBD. 

I recently came home from a ten-day on-site work project that takes place in a convention center in a midsized American city. Thousands of people participate in this work event every year; they come from many walks of life, different ages, ethnicities, regions, etc. A day in this temporary workspace is highly structured. From eight to five, thousands of people are working at their computers, which are arranged in tables of six to twelve, and those tables are grouped in task-oriented divisions of dozens to hundreds, with multiple task groups in one of several cavernous quasi-industrial spaces lit by stadium-powered LED lamps. All day long, each person works at their given task, side by side with some people, within sightline of others, earshot of more. At ten AM, everyone rises from their desk and the crowd flows out into one of a few broad corridors where there are snacks and beverages. After fifteen minutes, they return to their desks and resume work. At around noon, everyone makes their way to a cafeteria, grabs a tray and serves themselves a buffet lunch, sits down in a group or by themselves, eats and/or socializes for an hour, then back to the task, and later another break, then more of the same work until five. 

It's a workplace that's basically structured like a staggeringly over-scaled high school. It's not for everyone, and people who are prone to any kind of social anxiety might find aspects of it challenging. But people are generally copacetic and upbeat, and there’s a freedom to the lack of baggage that can lead to very interesting conversations. When all is said and done, it's a gig with clear boundaries that offers subsidized travel, and the pay isn’t bad.

One thing I know we all love is the kind of encounter where you have to walk through a space while people are walking towards you, and you have to decide with each passing person whether or not it's suitable to make eye contact, whether to nod or say a greeting, whether to smile or check internally to make sure that your face remains in a positive-neutral-relaxed position. In this workplace, you have to do this over and over again at regular intervals all day long. This could easily degenerate into constantly assessing your acquaintanceships with people you have previoiusly eaten lunch with, worked at a table with, had drinks with at a reception, etc. Due to the way the projects are set up, you find yourself crossing paths with a lot of the same people, over and over again, each day. 

This was my fourth year participating in this project. After your first year, you start to get to know some of the people who work in your area, in the uniquely limited ways that you can become familiar with people who basically have only this job in common. Most work in related fields, but again, they're coming from all over the place, and people mainly leave their home lives at home. This workplace exists only briefly on an annual interval, and lots of people only do the job once, but certain social networks arise. 

Around three days into the job, I noticed that certain members of the leadership in my area, and people in their general social circle, were...looking at me funny. It's a weird thing to verbalize noticing this, and at first I thought I was just being overly sensitive. The first time I clocked it, it was a person rather high up in the company making this face at me while we were in line at a dinner event. She's a fun, outspoken person, and in the moment, I thought she was just being spontaneously shitty by mocking the polite smile I smiled at her since I didn't have anything clever to say about the salad we were both reaching for. In that particular crowded venue, at her table was an individual I'll call J, and maybe eight other relatively-higher-level people who work in the same project.

By the time I got back to my room that night, three other people from that table had made that face at me as I passed them in various places. As the days went on, I noticed that other people in that group were making the face in increasingly exaggerated ways. While in an elevator, one of the people doing this happened to be in front of me, and I saw him stop a mutual acquaintance who looked like he was turning to talk to me while we waited to reach our floors. Instead of saying anything, he turned to me and made that face too. Both of these guys generally socialized with J. I came to notice that several of the women in J's social circle were not making that particular face at me, but rather seemed to be looking at me with some thing like curious pity when I would pass them. We'd nod or say hi, but they definitely looked like something was off.

Flashback: Three years ago, J was the person who trained me on that job, and monitored my performance with ongoing feedback. This was a stressful process for me, and throughout the days of that session, I was often consciously managing anxiety attacks of varying intensity. Part of the anxiety was knowing that J was keeping an eye on me, as he was everyone else at the table; that was his job. I quickly realized I was fighting the physical aspects of an anxiety attack just about every time we made eye contact. I started managing the anxiety by drawing parallel lines on a post-it pad; the focus of the action helped me regulate, and in a matter of less than a minute I'd be back on task. J is a perfectly nice person, affable and charming, and never did anything to draw attention to my anxiety. 

Next flashback: Two years ago, I was assigned to a different but related task where my workstation was in the neighborhood of J's. I realized that casual interactions with J had continued to create that anxiety response, even though I didn't work with him anymore. I started avoiding him, and when we would pass by in the course of the day, I guess I would either avoid eye contact, or give a sort of closed-mouth, eyebrow-raised nod. At one point, I actually stopped him and apologized for what must have seemed like not being very nice. He was totally cool about it and said he hadn't noticed anything, it was fine. We didn't talk again. 

The next time I saw him was at the beginning of this year's job. I was in a group meeting in a hallway-lounge area when he passed by. As he approached, and we made eye contact, he gave me a distinct look. If that look could be translated into words, it would be: Stay the fuck away from me. I had not seen that expression on his face before; again, he's typically a very easy going, friendly person. The face made my stomach drop. I hadn't expected to be working with him again, since each project is large and people are typically rotated through various projects within the area. I quickly realized that we had been set up at workstations about twelve feet apart from each other. What are the odds, right?

J worked with his back to me when he wasn't walking around to work with his team, and throughout the day, when he needed to discuss things with the leaders in our area, or to leave the room for any other reason, he would pass directly in front of me. I tried to avoid eye contact, and it helped that the glasses I wear at the computer limit my focal range so I can't quite make out facial expressions at a distance of more than twenty feet or so. I tried to just focus on the work, which often involved casual discussion with other people at my table. I did the job, and it was fine. I filled up about a single post-it a day with parallel lines.  I structured my break time and lunch routines to minimize the likelihood of running into him. If I had been a little more aware of what was going on, I think a wide-brimmed hat might have solved some problems. It was inevitable that I would keep passing by this guy multiple times a day and have to do something with my face. I didn’t come up with a conscious strategy, but he did not seem to want to chat, so I did my best to facially project something like “ha ha, it’s OK, this is me leaving you alone!” which I guess looked something like a little closed-mouth smile with raised eyebrows. 

And yes, within a few days, people in J’s circle were making parodies of that face back at me when I would pass them in the building. It was so weirdly aggressive, and so clearly deliberate, that I was at a total loss for how to respond. Otherwise, I talked with other people on the job a perfectly normal amount, and met a lot of really interesting people. I actually had a pretty good time, aside from this nonsense. But this nonsense, I have to tell you, really, really hurt. I hadn’t wanted to be a pain in the ass to anybody. I had received a distinct nonverbal message that I was not welcome, but I could only fuck off so far; I was there to work, like everybody else. 

I don’t know what J told people. I barely know the guy and I don’t know what he is going through in his life. I just know that he didn’t tell me anything; he did not speak to me at all. When we got to the final break time of the last day, I happened to pass him in a hallway. He wasn’t with anyone else, we were face to face, and without having figured out anything to say in advance, this time, I stopped him. As cheerfully and casually as I could, I said something like, “Hey, J, you think you can go the entire job without saying a single word to me? How have you been?” and he kind of laughed and said something like “Oh hey, how are you? How are things in (city where I’m from)?” And I’m looking at his face and seeing this rapid storm of inscrutable micro-expressions, none of which looks anything like it’s moving in the direction of an explanation or an apology. The eyes were saying something more like: what is the crazy bitch going to do?  So there was this silent beat. And I said, “Well, all right, that’s enough.” And I walked outside and across the street and got my coffee. And we went back to our desks and worked another two hours, and the job was over.

I didn’t go to the job closing reception that night, or the after-party, as I hadn’t gone to any of the project’s receptions or meetups since the weirdness had started. I wanted J to know that I wasn’t planning to come back to the on-site job next year, so I caught up with one of our mutual acquaintances as we were walking back to our hotel. I told her that people seemed to have been talking about me, and the way she seemed completely unsurprised told me that what I told her would make it back to J pretty quickly. She has been angling for a higher role in our area. I told her I was switching back to remote work going forward. I also told her this story:

I have a friend who made her career in fairly high-level corporate psychology. One time I was telling her about a problem I was having with a job. She told me: In the workplace, we are not ourselves. We are the roles that we shape ourselves into. Conflicts arise because inside, we’re still ourselves, and the roles we’re working in sometimes just don’t fit right. We want to be ourselves, but the role prevails.

What I hope she understood, and passed on, was that we had been working in a job where all day, fully grown adults were going through actions that structurally mirror a day of high school. So I guess this kind of thing was likely to happen. It did surprise me, though, and I’m still processing it.

1l8k57r,socialanxiety,The urge to self-harm after awkward events or interactions,"Does this happen to anyone else? I’m 30 years old and have had social anxiety since I was a child. It got better in my early 20s, then got significantly worse during & after the pandemic lockdown (which happened when I was 24) and hasn’t ever returned to “normal”. 

I just had something awkward happen to me and was telling a friend about it, and I began to over-explain myself which made the anxiety worse. I now have the urge to harm myself, which I’m not going to do, but it’s a reaction that comes up frequently when things like this happen. Likely because it would be an outlet that would make the stress & discomfort feel more physical instead of  that intense internal feeling.

1l8k3qt,ptsd,The value of service and connection,"Hi Everyone, this post is a bit different— but I hope some of you might find it helpful or at least hopeful. 
I have struggled with ptsd for about four years now. Realllyyy struggled. Constant panic episodes, isolation, night terrors, the whole nine. I felt really alone in this for a long time; I (now 21, F) was in my late teens during most of the acute adverse events, and I was completely under the impression that ptsd was something only veterans dealt with. 
This time was really lonely and scary, and I often considered giving up. I eventually met my therapist who completely saved my life, I truly owe everything to her. She helped me rediscover my empathy and desire to learn and help others, and eventually decide to go back to university. I realized I wanted to become a psychiatrist, so I started volunteering at a local VA hospital to gain some experience working with patients before applying to medical school (next cycle).
I have found immense joy, healing, and fulfillment from volunteering with veterans. After being so isolating and afraid of people (especially men) for so long, I was incredibly surprised at how much more connected I feel to most of the patients I see at the VA than anyone else. I don’t know if there is some subconscious or innate inner understanding between people who have experienced life changing trauma (I am not trying to compare traumas or events at all, I realize each persons experience is unique and context dependent) but being able to use my education in neuroscience and nutrition (and just general empathy and relatable experience) to help people who are struggling has been absolutely invaluable. I really hope anyone reading this considers two things: 1. It does get better, please please please hang in there. 2. By giving your time and empathy to others who are in need, you might improve your own trauma and well being in addition to theirs. I truly believe this can apply to anyone and everyone.

1l8iro7,depression,"I’m not suicidal, I just wish I didn’t exist","TW: self harm and suicide

18M, I’ve dabbled in self harm and I have thought about the concept of suicide a lot, but I wouldn’t say I am suicidal because I don’t have an active desire to end it all. I’m not actually diagnosed with anything, nor will I self diagnose, but I know fs there is something wrong with me. 

It’s odd to put into words and to be honest I don’t even understand it all the way through, it’s not that I wish I was never born or anything like that either, I just wish I kind of ceased to exist, where no one ends up feeling sad about it or anything. 

I’ve felt like this for a long time, but it’s been especially worse lately. I just graduated high school and right when everything seemed to be going okay, shit just kinda got shot down the drain for me(the funny part is that shit got bad on my very last day of school). It’s a lot and a long story but it’s been stressing me out and shit just keeps adding up, I know I’m sensitive to stress too as it’s literally a main trait of my personality type(INFJ). So what do I do? I procrastinate, and I try to forget as much as I can, I just try and avoid all the stress while I can. I’ve been clean of self harm for a while, but this stress makes me want to relapse. I started drinking when I can, it’s not good but it helps me forget.

The reason I’m posting this is because I’m getting my wisdom teeth out soon, doesn’t sound like much until they told me the painkillers they’ll give me is either gonna be oxycodone or hydrocodone. Long story short there’s a long history of drug addiction in my family, especially with opioid abuse, they killed my grandpa and almost killed my dad. I should very obviously be trying to avoid it, but there’s a part of me that really can’t wait for that prescription to come through. It sounds bad, and it is, but I’m starting to question the lengths I’ll go to just to avoid stress. 

The truth about me is that I’m a fucking asshole, I contribute nothing to society and if I disappeared tomorrow the effect would be minuscule, only affecting my family. I’m not really going anywhere in life, and I almost said I’m “just living”, but I’m not just living, I’m just not dying I guess. I don’t want to commit suicide, but I want to just not exist anymore. Sometimes I wish I had nothing in life anymore so I could just leave and start anew somewhere else in the world.

1l8il24,socialanxiety,The nagging feeling of not being liked by anyone around me,"Since I was very little I always felt like people didn't like me. Sure, there were times I've made people laugh or smile, I've even volunteered to help others in need with no questions asked. Hell, I've have a group of friends that have been there for me for almost 20 years. Yet, there has always been this dark feeling that no one *actually* likes me, finds me even remotely interesting, etc.

I overanalyze facial expressions, changes in moods and responses, which in turn makes me nervous and then I stumble on what I was going to say and I end up rambling or becoming awkward and making it worse. It always seems like I agitate others during conversations too, which leads me to not really speaking much at all and not really wanting to be there anymore. Or I lock up and go non verbal and panic when someone even asks me the simplest question. I've even caught people looking at me like I have 3 heads and it doesn't help whatsoever.

I've tried talking about different subjects and making sure I'm not going too off of the rails or anything, but I'm still having a hard time making new friends and new relationships. It's much harder now that I'm a single woman too, so not only do I feel like I can never make friends, I also feel like I can never love/find love again (it doesn't help that I got out of an abusive relationship recently either).

It honestly puts me into a deep depression, that I'll never be ""normal"", or have what everyone else has. Being invited out all the time, being romanced or hit on, having big celebrations where people know you or are happy to see you, those are things that I ***dream*** about, but I have a feeling that I'll never have that. I even get thoughts of s\*icide because I feel like I don't belong anywhere or that people are much better off without me. I'm currently in therapy, but it only does so much.

1l8hcbk,therapy,I had an emergency session with my therapist today after losing a loved one. I felt like I was talking to a wall.,"CW: >!suicide, loss of a grandparent!<

It's been a really rough couple of days. My grandma died on Sunday. We were incredibly close, and she was probably the most consistent presence in my life. Each of my parents disappeared from different periods of my life, but my grandma was always there, always my safe place, always my cheerleader. We even had the same birthday. But she'd been in chronic pain for years, and last year after her home was destroyed in one of the big hurricanes, she stopped wanting to tough it out anymore. We still talked and video called regularly (I live in a different state) and she always put on a happy face for me, but I knew she was struggling. And this past Sunday, the day before our birthday, she overdosed on her medication. It was almost definitely intentional.

So I've been kind of a mess. I'm sad that she's gone, and the same way you don't realize how much you use a muscle until you injure it, I'm really finding out how interwoven she is into the fabric of who I am. Everything reminds me of her. I'm mad that she chose to do it the day before our birthday, because how can I not take that at least a little bit personally? I'm agonizing over the last conversation I had with her, and how she seemed not herself, and I can't stop wondering if she knew that that would be the last time we would speak to each other.

I was able to get my therapist to slot me in for a virtual session today, 1.5 days after I received the news. I word-vomited what had happened and all the feelings that were at the top of my mind in the first 15 minutes of the session. I cried and ran out of words. I thought she would ask me questions about my grandma, our relationship, the feelings I was having, but instead we'd just be silent for a long time until I thought of the next related thought to bring up. And (if I went long enough without speaking) she'd respond with honestly pretty basic stuff like, ""It's okay to not know what to do right now,"" or ""this is a time to be kind to yourself,"" which just felt like platitudes that didn't lead anywhere.

It was really annoying and made me anxious. Like, I know that I laid some really heavy shit on her, but aren't therapists supposed to know how to guide these conversations?

After a really long gap of silence where I'd kind of stopped being upset about my grandma and started moreso panicking about not knowing what else I was supposed to say, she asked me, ""What is it you feel you need right now, KeepItWarmForMorn?"" What I couldn't figure out how to articulate at the time was that I needed someone to ask me questions to help me talk through the things I was feeling, and I was disappointed that she wasn't doing that. I felt like she didn't know how to respond to the things I was telling her. Which yeah I get it, I've been trauma dumped on by people and not known what to say, but I've also never tried to make a living having people tell me their problems.

I guess my question is, for people who have had good experiences with therapists for grief counseling, is this how it's supposed to go? Is the way I'm feeling my own fault because I don't know how to sit comfortably in silence? Is it my fault for not better communicating what I wanted/needed from the session? Should I be seeing a specialist for this? Or is my therapist just not very good at this?

I feel like maybe I should look for a new therapist—like she's fine and we've had some good talks, but this isn't the first session I've come away from feeling like I wasted my time. But I've been with this lady for over a year and am exhausted by the idea of starting over with someone new.",2025-06-11 02:23:51,3,1,KeepItWarmForMorn,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1l8hcbk/i_had_an_emergency_session_with_my_therapist/,True,Advice Wanted,

I was always called shy or quiet by teachers and that continued as I got older. in junior high it just ended up with me barely having any friends. and in high school as well. i could just tell people found me annoying. I remember being made fun of. and people just didn’t want to talk to me. like I would remember being with a friend and people would talk to them and seemingly ignore me. I dotn know what it was. I don’t know what was wrong with me. no one ever approached me. i only had one friend group in junior high and that was it. and tbh i didn’t even like them that much. and I don’t know how I got through it looking back. there was so many times where I would completely alone in a class or at lunch. while seeing people around me just talking and hanging out. like I finished junior high and felt empty. like idk I felt like I didn’t even start yet. and high school was that continued. so many classes I was completely alone. and like teachers never had an issue with it because I got good grades. but I hated it. I made like 0 new friends and like I jsut felt stuck. I seriously tried. I would be as outgoing as possible. I would approach people. but idk no matter what they never stick around. and graduated high school. and was jsut depressed. so many people aground me were happy and with friends. and I was just there. I felt nothing. I wasn’t ready to graduate. I needed more time it felt like. idk what to do.  no matter how hard I try no one actually wants to talk to me. I’ve missed out on so much. like every possible teen experience. ive never been invited to a party, dance, or any hangout really. and i didnt have a birthday party since i was like 10. because im too scared to invite people. because i doubt im interesting enough for them to go. and I probably wouldn’t be fun.
but I remember that like other kids would only talk to me because they thought I was smart. and like being called nice and smart were like the only compliments I would get for my entire life. and that’s like the only time i felt valued. so that just led me placing so much importance on my grades for the rest of my life. like for years I placed grades above my own physical and mental health. and like that feeling of missing out is just made worse by being trans. I’ve never in my entire life felt comfortable in my body. and I would just see other girls and just be so envious. like for the longest time I didn’t what it was. but I just remember avoiding any videos/ photos of me because I didn’t want to see me or hear my voice. and something always felt off. and I remember like idk feeling like I had to prove my masculinity. so everytime someone called me out as feminine in any capacity I would jsut be really defensive and stuff. but idk it was like a daily thing in years where I would pray that I would turn into a girl. and like when I leaned about being trans I was really scared. and I didn’t come out to anyone for years. and then I came out to my parents and I hated it. liek they weren’t exactly hateful or anything but i was so uncomfortable. like they weren’t exactly hateful acting like something is wrong with me. and were saying I couldn’t tell anyone until I had I talked to the entire family about it. and I kept trying to leave because I felt so uncomfortable and vulnerable. but they wouldn’t let me. and they kept asking questions. and I kept telling them I wanted to leave but they wouldn’t let me. and my mom started crying eventually. and that scared me off from coming out to others for so long. idk now I just feel so sad everytime I hear girls talking about “girly” experiences and stuff. cuz like I’ll never have that. i just feel like my life’s been robbed. and ill never get it back. and I hate my family. in my entire life I’ve never felt safe around them. recently as well there’s been so many times where they yell, swear, threaten, lie, gaslight, manipulate, imprison, and hit me. and all while deflecting any blame and blaming me for my mental health. and they would have my siblings gang up on me as well. i have no one to turn too. my whole I never did. I’ve just been forced to keep everything to myself and hide my emotions. there’s only been a couple people I’ve had the chance to and both times it didn’t end well. i just an annoying, boring, and uninteresting person. I’ve never in my life felt like someone actually liked talking to me. I don’t think I’ll ever actually be happy. I dotn even know what happiness feels like at this point. I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. I dotn want to die but now it feels like the only choice. and maybe people would actually notice or care for once. idk i im jsut worried that im just overreacting and being selfish. like at this point i feel like im the problem. and im a bad person. who deserves this. I genuinely don’t know what’s wrong with me. all I know is that I’ll never be happy. but I’m to scared to kill myself.

I’ve never been liked. I have no one to turn to for support. I already know all I’m going to do in the summer is play video games because that’s the only time I dotn feel depressed. I’m to unmotivated to get a job. and I’m probably just using that as an excuse as me being too lazy and shy to get a job. I’m so pathetic. nothing will ever work out for me. idk what’s wrong with me. maybe if I kill myself before school ends then people might notice or care. I already know if I do it after school ends no one outside my family, who I hate, will notice. genuinely what’s the point. it’s probably my fault. I’m just making myself the victim in everything. because I’m so self centred. I’m so terrible. I’m so tired of being jsut ignored and forgotten.

This is my first ever post on Reddit.
English is not even my first language, so Im sorry for the typos and shit.

So where do I begin..Im F 23.
I am a bad person.
I am a nobody , liar, a bad person. I have anger issues.
Im mean. 
Im antisocial, introvert,weird, highschool dropout.
I have NOTHING going on in my life except Im in a relationship for like 9 years now. 
He is the best person ever I don’t even know why is he with me still.
I had a horrible childhood, like many of us do.
Alcoholic abusive drug addict dad and a mom who was-is probalby mentally ill too.
Since I was 0 years old I was abused mentally and physically too. And I had to watch my dad abuse my mom too who has heart problems since forever.
In elementary school kids would kick me and bully me bc of my clothes, bc of my dad, everything I didn’t had control of.
In highschool they did the same. I dropped out and went to live with my bf.
Since then I stopped living. Despite being bullied and abused I was kind of ok in highschool..
I had some friends maybe like 3..
I wasn’t introverted.
Now look at me.
I don’t even go out of the fucking house anymore.
Wherever I go ppl look at me with nasty eyes. I know they judge me. Who wouldn’t tbh.
I get it. Im a shit show.
 And Im so embarrassed,ashamed.
My depression took my life away literally.
I have zero friends zero social life zero nothing 😂
And Its all my fault.
Bc Im not capable. 
I am a waste of a human.
It got to a point where I really wanna end it. 
I just know that my mom and a few ppl would be very shocked and sad about my death.
So Im here for now.
Im self aware too so no therapy for me..and tbh I don’t believe in it. I think for me there is no help.

I am a fucking horrible person and I deserve every fucking bit of this life. 

The worst part? I hate my dad. But when I think about him, that he is alone, drinking his life away I feel sorry for him, and me. Bc I see him in me. Im sorry for what he went through his childhood. He could had us. But he choose alcohol despite the promises. Now he is alone, Im alone. So congrats dad you made it. 
You created this hell for us. U and me are the same. We are both alone even tho we could have done better. We wouldn’t . And maybe that’s for the better.  We are both horrible. I am my fathers daughter.

I’ve noticed something that’s starting to bother me a bit. I masturbate almost every night, and it’s become such a routine that I can’t really fall asleep unless I do it.

It started because it helped me relax and fall asleep faster, especially at night when my mind would be busy. But now it feels like I’ve trained my body to rely on it, and on the nights I skip it, I just lie there awake for ages.

Important note: I don’t use p*rn at all. It’s just imagination, but still, the habit feels kind of locked in.

It’s all the time. I cannot switch it off. I’m comfortable and at ease when I’m alone. But as soon as at least one other person is in a position where I feel they could potentially “judge” me or form an opinion on what I say or do, I’m get anxious. I put barriers up to protect myself from potential judgment. Every single thing I say in front of someone, there’s that eye in the back of my mind watching to make sure I don’t say something stupid to bring judgment upon myself. Every action I take in front of someone, no matter the situation or act, there is a voice that questions how I’m coming across right now. It’s on all the time and there doesn’t feel like there’s any off switch. And I just don’t know how to turn it off because it makes me worry I’ll be like this forever and will never form a meaningful relationship with anyone.

1l88o8y,therapy,What You Should Know Before Starting Therapy,"Therapy can be overwhelming at first, and there are a lot of misconceptions out there. In case someone is considering or just getting started, here are a few things to know: 

* Therapy isn’t just for people in crisis. You can go to therapy to better understand yourself, work through past events, or just build better coping skills.
* Not every therapist will be a perfect match. A good therapist will not take it personally if you decide they’re not the right fit.
* Unpacking tough stuff can be emotionally draining at first. You’re stirring up things you might have buried for a long time. But the process gets lighter and more empowering as you go.
* You’ll have ups and downs. Some weeks you’ll feel like you’re making huge strides; other times, you’ll wonder if you’re getting anywhere. That’s normal, healing isn't linear.
* There’s no “right” way to do therapy.

1l87vtp,mentalhealth,My name’s Mark. Catching anxiety early has been a game-changer – and my phone was making that way harder,"I’ve had OCD since college. My (super smart) therapist, Chad LeJeune would call what I have **“pure O.”** Overthinking spirals, catostrophic thinking, dovetails into depression, etc.

Lately, I’ve noticed something: I can usually manage my anxiety if I catch it while it’s still low-level. But once it tips into full-on panic mode it’s almost impossible to pull myself back.  Someone else on Reddit said this (can’t find that post) and I’m realizing I totally agree. 

That realization made me look harder at what triggers the early stages – and honestly my biggest early triggers were 1) phone 2) political news 3) not sticking with my mindfulness, self-love, and exercise consistently. All these tiny inputs slowly raised my baseline anxiety.

So I experimented. I downloaded a screentime app that locks me out of the worst offenders (you can’t easily bypass the blocks). I moved my mindfulness, self-love, and exercise practices to first thing in the morning, when my discipline threshold is highest (thanks to another Redditor for that advice).  

What changed:

* I noticed the early signs of anxiety more clearly. I wasn’t drowning them out with noise.
* I didn’t spiral. Without the constant feed of triggering content, my mind stayed quieter.
* I slept better. No surprise, but still kind of miraculous – probably bc of more consistent meditation and exercise. 

**Curious if anyone else feels like anxiety is more manageable when you catch it early?**

I was walking back to work from getting lunch during my break. The EMT told me what I experienced was a panic attack. I thought that would never happen again. Then I had another panic attack 2 weeks later at work. My boss drove me to the ER. CT scan, x-ray and everything showed I was fine. Doctors said it was anxiety. Decided to see a cardiologist because there was no way anxiety could make me feel this terrible. Wore a holter monitor for 2 weeks…all was good. Echocardiogram and stress test were good. 

Then everything got worst, I was scared to be at work because that’s where my panic attacks happened and anxiety would go up. Demanded that I work from home until I ultimately quit because the physical symptoms from anxiety made me feel incapable of working. Things got worse in October, I realized I was scared to go outside because what if I have a panic attack outside? Will there be someone to help me? Then I was scared of my heart racing at all…so I stopped being active. I bought a fitness watch and checked my heart rate every moment, if it was over 100bpm I’d sit down. This crushed my spirit because I loved running, biking, walking, hiking, etc. 

Started seeing a therapist in October and she has helped some. I’ve also been on Zoloft since February which has also helped. But it’s now June 2025, a whole year after my first panic attack. I’m still not working, I’m still mostly home, I started working out but not running or biking yet. I also still get nervous when I’m out, the farther I’m from my house, the more nervous I am. 

A couple minutes ago my heart sunk and I felt like I couldn’t breathe and thought (are you kidding me another panic attack?) because that’s usually how they start for me. 

Now I’m just sitting here thinking is this my life? I used to be ambitious, active, bubbly, I hate all of this. It crushes my spirit. I’ve been praying more often and trying to trust in God with what He’s doing with me, but I’m also just completely over all of this. All the physical sensations, all the random heart flutters, the random aches and pains, the not going out, the way it’s impacting my relationships, the fact that I’m not working, the fact that I can’t support myself financially anymore.

1l850ua,bpd,Husband is sucking the life out of me,"My husband (60) of 30 years is literally wearing me down. I think his BPD episodes are getting worse and lasting longer. Recently, I (52) calmly mentioned to him I was concerned about his alcohol consumption. He has a Hx of substance abuse and his ENTIRE family are all either former alcoholics or died from their alcoholism.  And, just for further clarification, a week ago he told me he realized he was drinking too much and intended to quit.

Fast forward one week and he’s working in the yard and I can tell he’s drunk. I asked him and he denied having more than a couple. I said it’s pretty obvious he isn’t being honest with himself. That turns into the “you hate me! Why can’t you just love me for who I am? Am I not doing enough?” I can tell he’s about to flip, so I try to walk away quietly and that sends him into full blown “why are you abandoning me?!?!” All I want to do is get the hell away so I feel more comfortable and so I can comfort our daughter (20) who is Autistic and intellectually disabled. Our daughter is witnessing this and screaming “Daddy stop!” He literally can’t stop. That was Sunday. This morning, before marriage counseling (which he initiated) he starts getting heated, again and screaming. Calls me a bitch so I leave the house. Now he’s texting telling me he’s sorry and he’s having a breakdown. The ONLY reason I return home is to make sure my daughter is safe. She’s safe but she is trying to comfort him which makes me so angry. Anyway, relay this to the therapist and allow him to use his over the top adjectives about how I berate him and demean him. Therapist suggested he quit drinking for 30 days and use those 30 days to allow me to walk away when I feel like I need to. Husband is butt hurt by these suggestions! The last request he made as we were leaving the office was, “please don’t be mad at me.”

JFC!  A someone here explain why I’m never allowed to be mad at him? If I am, he’s in a puddle of rage and tears “begging “ me to not be mad. I have pleaded with him to sit with an emotion and let it pass but he can’t. He doesn’t believe I can love him and be mad at the same time.

Most of my teen years were spent dealing with severe acne, which absolutely destroyed my self-esteem. I was on Accutane last year and it completely cleared it , I’m honestly so thankful for it.

But now a new insecurity has taken over… my penis size. I’ve never really thought about it before, but recently I started comparing when I accidentally saw some of my friends, and mine looks smaller even when I’m erect. It’s around 13 cm long and about 11 cm circumference of the thickest part of the penis when I am fully fully erect.i have heard people say girth matters more than length but I don't even have good girth.I keep worrying , is it small?

I've made so many lifestyle changes that have helped (in my control), a few huge life events have passed (not in my control), and honestly - it's been a beautiful summer where I live. Old, good habits are returning to me.

Like, if I’m in a group and there’s this one guy who is really confident, charming, or just gives off that ""everyone likes him"" vibe, I kind of shut down. My thoughts get loud, I second-guess myself, and I just want to disappear.

When I was a child I hated myself and my life, and now that I'm older nothing's changed. I am still young, and I do get through my day like everyone else, but I'm curious if anyone else has ever felt constantly unhappy with the concept of being alive. I would much prefer my mother never had me than be living, and the strange thing is I don't think my opinion would change if my life was any different. I didn't have the best childhood, nothing crazy abusive luckily but still not the best, and I honestly think that even if I was born into a financially stable, loving family, with a body I felt comfortable in, I'd still feel just as miserable about existing as I do now. It's not like I've never had anything fun before, I've enjoyed myself on vacations and hanging out with friends etc etc, but there's always been this underlying feeling of misery constantly present in my life, and this constant dissatisfaction with existence as a whole. I'm lucky to the point it hasn't become overwhelming yet but suicide has always been lingering in the back of my mind for years, I wonder if this is how ill always feel, if I can do much about this or ill just have to live with the idea I'll be at least a bit unhappy my whole life",2025-06-10 11:35:52,241,33,Throwawayyy67936,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1l7wfnp/is_it_normal_to_just_not_want_to_be_alive/,False,,

> _Moving forward, any post that is not directly related to BPD (Rule 1) must use this flair or it will be removed. Posts must still follow/meet other sub posting criteria or can still be removed._

Change and/or growth are inevitable.

Over the last little while the mod team as well as many of you, the members, have noticed more and more of certain types of posts (we've seen them, the comments, and the reports). 

Posts where BPD is not mentioned.  
Posts questioning affecting symptoms that are not diagnostic criteria of BPD but other disorders or (un)related challenges.  
Posts that are better suited for a private journal entry.  
Posts that frankly don't contribute much to the sub save for perpetual shouting into the echo chamber.

These type of posts and the members who post them are increasing much faster than our small team can keep up.  
As a result, the team has made the decision to allow these posts with one condition:  
**If your post DOES NOT follow RULE ONE of the sub - All posts must be directly related to BPD - you must use the [Off My Chest/Journal] tag/flair.**

Posts are still subject to removal if they do not meet other sub posting criteria even with use of this flair (ie we will still remove your [Off My Chest/Journal] tagged posts if they include stigmatizing or anti-psychiatric rhetoric, religion and politics, unwelcome or disruptive language, descriptions of self-harm or substance use/abuse etc).

While some of you may disagree with this decision, for now, this change comes as a necessary one in order to continue fostering a safe space for our members while allowing our team to moderate more effectively.

> _The **[Venting]** tag is being replaced with an **[Off My Chest/Journal]** tag/flair._

Whether you’re curious about:

1k1r8mi,bpd,Process of Removing Posts,"Hey guys! I wanted to take some time to clarify some misconceptions going around about the process of moderating this subreddit. For awhile now, we’ve noticed an influx in misinformation regarding our motivations to remove posts. So, I wanted to go over some information to clear things up.

**Who are we?**

We're a small team of volunteers, all with the lived experience of BPD. Many of us are in recovery, or have recovered, and are committed to reducing stigma and supporting the community. We're also human and sometimes make mistakes, but we’re here to help and appreciate every report and modmail. Members reporting posts and comments make our jobs a LOT easier, which I’ll get into shortly. 

**How moderation works:**

For most of our moderating, an automod bot helps us. The automod bot works by detecting keywords in posts that are associated with rule violations. It’s not perfect — sometimes it removes things that are totally fine. For example, you might be sharing a post about how you feel like this disorder is slowly killing you. The automod bot sees the word “kill” and thinks it should be removed. We review these as quickly as we can, but there’s a lot of content and only a few of us. If your post gets removed, it may just be in the queue waiting for review. If you see a comment or post breaking the rules, and are wondering where the mods are at, please report it! In a server of 300,000+ people and just a handful of us, we can’t always see everything.

**My post was removed without a reason sent to me. What’s going on?** 

If your post was immediately removed without a removal reason sent to you, the automod bot immediately removed it or put it into a queue for review. Mods may be asleep, at work, or simply catching up. If it’s been a few hours and you haven’t heard anything, please send us a modmail — we’re happy to take a look! 

**A quick ask:**

We know moderation can feel frustrating. But unkind comments and assumptions about our intentions are discouraging and drive good mods away. We’re all going through this journey of recovery together, and we want to make sure everyone has support available to them here. I want to reassure you that we’re doing our best because we care deeply about this space and want to foster an environment that’s supportive of recovery. You can help us out by reporting comments and posts that violate the rules! If you have any comments or concerns, please reach out to us by modmail.



***TL;DR: If your post was removed, it’s likely the automod bot. Give it a few hours for a human to take a look, then send us a modmail. We’re here to help and we appreciate members reporting rule-violating posts/comments to help us out.*** ",2025-04-17 23:48:02,57,18,skinkess,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1k1r8mi/process_of_removing_posts/,False,:lightbulb: Mod Post,
1jys8x9,depression,"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",2025-04-14 06:26:08,39,67,SQLwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jys8x9/regular_checkin_post_with_essential_information/,False,,
1jxupif,therapy,Our AI Policy,"Hello, r/therapy!

We have received several reports, comments, and messages regarding AI in our community. We have come to the conclusion to implement an AI policy for our community as outlined below. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us! 

Best regards,

r/therapy Mod Team

Policy:

Discussion - We allow discussion of the ethics, impact, and results of the use of AI in therapy and as therapy.

Promotion - While discussion of AI and AI therapy is allowed, promotion of specific sites, tools, or of AI as a replacement for therapy is not. While AI can be a supplemental tool in mental health, it is not currently a safe, effective replacement for therapy. 

Example:

Allowed: “I think AI could help the mental health community by doing \[x\]”

Not Allowed: “Real therapists are all narcissists. AI is the best way to get therapy.” 

Use - The purpose of r/therapy is for authentic, human interactions. The use of generative AI to write posts or comments is prohibited. You are welcome to use AI to check facts (note: AI does get things wrong), come up with synonyms, and otherwise proofread your content but using AI to fully write your posts/comments is not allowed. 

Example: 

Allowed: Asking AI for a synonym, fact check, or to have a concept explained

Not Allowed: Pasting a question to AI and then replying with the AI’s response.

(Note: these examples are not exhaustive and removal of posts and comments under the AI fall under moderator discretion)

1iwvbzn,anxiety,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thursday club, Friday just the two other fiends because I was working, and for Saturday was schedule for the three of us.

On Saturday I texted them early afternoon saying I was all ready to hangout at night but u was going for some family dinner “not important” , and they can text me when to leave and change outfits, they say it’s ok we’ll let you know, about 5 or of them let’s call her, Emma, told me “be ready at 8, I’ll pick you up” and said it’s okay, at about 7 o’clock I check find my (we do share locations) and noticed that they were together it look odd because we didn’t agree to get ready together but I brushed it off, by 7:30 I told her “I’m finishing up some things” in 15 I’ll be at your house is way easier, she just sent and sticker of side eye and annoying looking, 10 minutes pass by and I’m driving calling them non stop that I was on my way, and they could wait for me something told me to check their loc, and they were already on the highway close to the destination (mind you I had the time) that’s when I felt ugly in my stomach and ofc I got sad because they didn’t communicate anything I got ghosted after like 10 calls and messages to wait for me and blabla . 

And hour and half passed by the other friend,Sara, text in our group chat after leaving all my previous messages in seek for ten minutes texted “saying I’m sorry my love, we just got here and we didn’t see the calls” and ofc in my mind I say that’s bullshit, because they always have the phone on sound. I never open that message. 

Mind you every time we used to go out the day after we brief about the time we had even if it was just 2 of us we let the other know how’d it go, and that don’t happed after that event, none of them text back something, but 3/4 days after like nothing happened. 


A week and a half pas by and Sara texted me, “hi girly what’s going on why haven’t you texted back at the group chat we know you are upset about something, what is it” they know that damn well, and I explained to her what upset and that was way out of line and they did no has boundaries, and I let out other things too on how Emma was always so apatic and negative to me lately even when I called her out for that because I don’t like it and she said at the time “sorry I’m like that sorry if I’m not that sentimental and dramatic as you are, life is not that serious”
Besides that, Sara explain that she didn’t have any clue about it, that apparently Emma told her it was a plan that came out at last minute and they didn’t have time for other things, and that’s why they were together because Sara fall asleep and Emma came to her house to wake her up, beachside the plan of “8:0pm” was cancelled. And I told her that I had no idea, that Emma dint tell me about it, and if she dint mean to why she wasn’t  the one who sent the text “ we just got here” that night, it’s is so odd and off, and she knows that she messed up and that’s why she sent sara to text me. Mind you no one has been ever said sorry about it and still no contact until 2 days ago

Sara was inviting me to go have dinner, when she picked me up she said that Emma was coming, mind you I haven’t talk to none of them about anything because the communication has been off, neither Sara hasn’t talked to me about her days as she used to, well anyways, during dinner it was just them talking about how good we’re having it they only together the pass days, and me off no clue about it and kept asking me what’s my opinion and ofc none because I don’t know anything, well dinner was complete awkward Emma tried to apologize but they were other friends in common and tolde her it wasn’t the right moment or environment to talk about it, and sera it’s saying I’m taking things out hand, and I’m being dramatic

Mind you Emma and I have been fighting lately because she’s always pointing how am I the plan c friend, the cactus friend, the one that I’m not the most fun to hang out with, I’m the left out friend, tag doesn’t need all the attention because I’m independent, and she reminds me I was the third friend to ever come to the friendship and should felt bad about it ",2024-12-11 03:49:11,1,0,aylenrivers,https://www.reddit.com/r/counseling/comments/1hbkr4o/am_i_right_by_ending_that_friendship/,False,,
1hadhvc,counseling,Counseling for those with chronic pain,"Hi everyone, I've been dealing with chronic pain for almost 20 years now. I've had to reshape my life several times because of it and have seen the impact it has on mental health, relationships, and life in general first hand. I've also seen the lack of support and understanding from others, including people I thought were my closest loved ones. 

As a result, I'm thinking about starting a text/phone/and maybe video chat based counseling service for people with chronic pain. I have my bachelor's degree in psychology, and completed almost my entire masters degree in counseling. My pain and injuries prevented me from finishing that degree. I've worked in the field in many capacities despite the lack of the degree, but I think that maybe my chronic pain can be the key to helping others. Maybe this all happened for a reason. Maybe I can use it for good. 

I know how hard it is for those to find true support from others who haven't experienced chronic pain. Just out of curiosity, would anyone be interested in text based, or perhaps phone and video chat counseling with someone who also deals with it daily? I'm thinking, one of the main benefits could be that I'd be available to help at night when flare ups occur and at a moment's notice.

1gd9l9c,mentalhealth,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

1g3aedm,counseling,Is my brother manipulating me again ,"Hello, my brother is a person indoors not want around me. He is a:
Alcoholic 
Has anger issue towards me and my mum
He is abusive towards his girlfriend physically and emotionally 
He has no respect towards anyone but special me and my mum.
He has history or drug abuse 
He has had violent history , he choose the wrong people to hang out with
He is visibly unstable in his mind. 
He is racist
He is homophobic despite his own sister who is lesbian
He is sexists and hates other religions etc...

We tried to help him with antiseptic, therapy, being nice human beings towards his, trying to connect with him, he pushes everything away, despite initially saying he wants help and he knows he is not well he wants to change, but when we push to help he kicks off and gets angry at us. I offered him help for years. But he does not want any of it.

 We have a standard cycle with him. We would have a big fight then we would ignore eachother for 2 weeks and slowly he will start warming up to us again. Things will be ok for few more week, my mum and I will step on eggshells around him, untill something happens and he or we snap.
Then we have a huge fight and depending on the outcome of the fight - if I asked him to move out or not - he would start sending messages to me which I used to interpret as cry for help. Now I know they are not despite him saying he is sorry for the way he is, he is sorry we don't like him, he just wants love, and sends images of him self harming...

This has happened many times. I would offer help after that in the form of professional help, he would agree and when we actually get to talking with the professionals he would start to get angry and pushy and we would have another fight..

I am tired. He is my brother  and I have more disappointment and disgust towards him than love. I almost feel like I don't care anymore if he really needs help or not. He is ruining my life and my mum's life just like my dad did... Am I projecting my emotions towards dad into my brother? I don't think so, mum and my aunt also tell me my brother is my brother reborn and I can just see history repeating itself.

Is my brother manipulative? Is he able to accept help? I am tired. I don't want to offer him any help anymore. I want him out of my life ... Am I wrong for that? ",2024-10-14 07:27:26,1,1,AnitaDobreva,https://www.reddit.com/r/counseling/comments/1g3aedm/is_my_brother_manipulating_me_again/,False,,

1e297nd,mentalhealth,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",2024-07-13 12:25:58,22,27,DrivesInCircles,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e297nd/rmentalhealth_is_looking_for_moderators/,False,Mod Post,

doqwow,depression,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2019-10-29 14:52:02,2359,177,SQLwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,False,,
1l8nbov,mentalhealth,I hate how I constantly shut down,"Whenever there is someone I can talk to about my issues and mental illness I constantly keep shutting down.

For example if my friends ask how I am doing etc I plan to tell them and talk about it when it actually comes to it i just say I am okay and don’t talke about it.

Or when I go to seek help from like a professional for example to my doctor before I get extremely anxious and near a panick attack but once the dots is there I shut down and become emotionless empty as if I am a robot 

Last time I told my friend we need to meet because it’s important my friend said they don’t have time so we said we‘ll meet way later, and then my friend called me out of nowhere to check in with me but my auto response was to act normal and talk about silly things 

Now I think my friend might think I am not being serious but the thing is I don’t want to talk about those things over the phone and even then I fear I might shut down

I am not sure why I keep doing this but I keep thinking it’s maybe because I am so lonely I really feel lonely and felt for so long.

I also feel like I have to keep up this facade and that I shouldn’t be burdening anyone, I feel so distant when I have to talk about it and I keep thinking about how they are normal and I can’t talk about it because it makes me not normal and this broken person

1l8naxv,therapy,"Too Broke 2 Ask a Therapist IRL this, really need some feedback rn.","Context: keeping brief for sake of privacy. 

A sibling had an episode last year, well psych facility labeled it “psychotic break”. 

However, upon further investigation from my family we found out the facility was shady, and so was the psychiatrist. 

Long story short, my sibling never had any mental breakdowns in the past, no past behavior of mania, or even bipolar/schizod type behavior. To my families knowledge, after asking around no one in our immediate, nor as far back as we knew documented or otherwise had such behavior either.  So, it was very odd that they labeled them that on paperwork… don’t want to retell full story for sake of privacy reasons. 

They were released. We had reason to believe the breakdown was cannabis induced. My sibling agreed, but also still tried to argue that it wasn’t and was stress related. We said okay, accepted it. Spent the year doing everything we could to help them heal through it . We didn’t inform anyone in our family, or even their friends to respect their privacy. So only myself(their sibling), and the immediate family around when it occurred know. 

I never told anyone till this day. The situation was quite traumatizing for me and my whole family and my sister. She did go to therapy briefly after it happened, we did a healing thing via zoom(kinda wacky but we wanted try anything), and asked them if they wanted to do outpatient they were on the fence - ultimately cause of  cost we couldn’t do it. . She also weaned off the meds they gave her the short time in the facility and was fine, what they gave her made her a legit zombie like some girl interrupted shit. 

Anyway, she was able to go back to normal and move forward and turn a new leaf. I was very proud of her strength and perseverance, thru it all. 

But, tonight she came in the house eyes all red. At first I just laughed it off, but then I texted her and just asked straight up are you smoking again? 

She said yes, and sent me a bunch of emoji’s. I felt very hurt by her response. I just didn’t reply. Idk if I should tell my mom. Pretty sure the reason she is smoking again is because we all been arguing(toxic household). I am really stumped how to move forward. My moms already upset rn due to our fight , and i’m supposed to be moving back to my dads soon but now i’m scared she will have another episode and my mom will start drinking again… my moms been doing good. She relapsed in March for one day, but she hasn’t again. 

My sibling is in their early 30s and i am in my late 20s.

1l8n923,bpd,I hate that BPD ruined my academic potential.,"I’m not trying to sound like a gifted kid burnout cliché. But I know I’m highly intelligent. I know I have academic potential. I thrive by learning. I’ll get obsessed with some niche topic for no reason and spend hours learning it inside out. But when it comes to something I need to study like an exam tomorrow? My brain and body just shut down.

Like. Literally. My brain’s like “nope.” It’s not even procrastination at this point, it’s pure self sabotage. And I know I’m doing it. That’s the most infuriating part. I know that if I just sat down and studied, I would pass. I’m smart enough. I understand things fast. But I still don’t do it.

Not “lazy,” not “unmotivated” I literally cannot bring myself to do it. My body freezes. I want to do it, but I don’t. And the worst part? I know I could. I’m trapped in this cycle of knowing I’m capable and still doing nothing about it. It’s torture.

The self sabotage part of my BPD is next level. It’s not lazy. It’s not a discipline issue. It’s like I’m allergic to doing things that could actually improve my life. And it’s driving me insane

Sometimes I think… maybe if I hadn’t been this way, I could’ve had a completely different life. I could’ve achieved so much. I could’ve actually become something. And instead, I’ve sabotaged myself so badly that even I don’t recognize who I am anymore.

1l8n7q0,anxiety,Eye floaters are causing me severe anxiety/stress,"For context I’m 19m, and I know it sounds stupid that something small like eye floaters is affecting me so bad mentally, but I don’t have your average/normal amount of eye floaters. I have so many in both eyes that it’d be impossible to count them all. It’s like a black fishnet over my vision. I have dark ones, clear ones, blurry ones, long lines and dots, cobwebs. For the past like 3 months I’ve probably spent at least 70-80% of my day worried about them, and the anxiety is hurting my chest. Besides the floaters I have perfectly normal 20/20 vision, so I have no idea how I’ve gotten so many. They’ve only started forming in the last 2 years, and if they’ve gotten this bad then I can’t imagine what it’ll be like 10 years from now. I’ve been to an ophthalmologist to have my eyes dilated and checked, but he didn’t see anything wrong. In fact he said he didn’t even see any floaters. How is it possible that I have so many yet the doctor couldn’t even see them. I’ve heard you get used to them, and I was able to be used to them when they were just in the peripheral of my vision, but now they’re starting to get closer to the middle of my vision and I’m terrified. Going outside is legitimately scary for me, and I’ve been staying indoors for the most part recently. They haven’t gotten so bad yet that they make task harder or reading/seeing harder, but idk how I’m supposed to function normally if I have about 80 dark lines and dots swirling around my vision. Does anyone else experience floaters similar to this? The only operation right now to get rid of floaters is a surgery called a vitrectomy, but I absolutely do not have money for it, and it carries a lot of risk and isn’t recommended for floaters unless they’re so bad you can’t see.",2025-06-11 08:18:14,1,0,dismxbeisbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1l8n7q0/eye_floaters_are_causing_me_severe_anxietystress/,False,Health,new

1l8n72o,depression,I'm trapped,"I'm 31M. I've struggled mightily with anxiety and depression since high school. Right before COVID hit, I had my first panic attack and I gave up trying to function at all. Prior to COVID and the panic attack, even though I struggled a lot, I still tried to fight it. I wasn't very successful, but I still tried. Anyway, for the past 5ish years I've basically done nothing. About a year ago, my Mom and I had to move out of the apartment we were living in because the landlord wanted to sell it. It's really expensive where we live, so, for the past year we've been living in a studio, sharing a bed. It's incredibly difficult. I love my Mom and I feel very loyal to her, but she's incredibly dysfunctional herself. She's really depressed, goes to bed at 3 or 4am every night, and I suspect has BPD. Plus, she controls my bank account, monitors my email (the one she knows about) , and took away my phone before COVID and haven't had one since. I don't think I'm entitled to a phone, especially when she's mostly supporting me, but it speaks to the hole I'm in. In her mind she thinks she's helping me by monitoring and controlling everything.

1l8n2cc,mentalhealth,anybody who needs to hear this.,"if you’re struggling with something that you think is stupid or minor or small, but it means a lot to you, then me too. and if you struggle to get over it no matter how much you try, me too. i should take my own advice but i feel typing it would make it better for me.

  
dont let what other people say affect you. if it isnt family, you can cut these people off, and if youre in school (like me) then you aren’t even gonna speak to them in like 2 years from now. it seems like a long time but by then you can probably look back and laugh at this. family is a bit more complicated. but just know if you didn’t do anything and it’s them that keeps starting stuff or won’t leave you alone, they’re the problem. they have their own stuff they’re dealing with and that’s not your fault and nor should you feel bad for it. people always say that if someone’s giving you a hard time, they’re probably dealing with something at home. but that’s unfortunate for them. why should you suffer? as long as they aren’t physically hurting you, just remember it’s them and not you. but if it is you, just take accountability. talking from experience. if you’re  the problem or not, talking to them will not always help. some people just aren’t mature enough to let things go. not everybody’s gonna like you and want to be your friend either.

there are unfortunately a lot of weird people in this world that need help. and even if you need therapy, there isn’t anything wrong with that. its always best to let your feelings out. things won’t always go the way you want them to, but maybe try changing your perspective. for me, i had some bullies that i wanted to keep trying to talk to and make things right but it would never work and they just never left me alone and always hurt me, but it really dwelled on me because i had the mindset “when will they just like me. when will this be over. why can’t they like me. why is it always me.” but, if you start seeing yourself as the main character in your life, things will change. maybe they won’t, but the way you view yourself will and that’s all that matters. try working on yourself, and instead of thinking like i did, try saying instead. “it’s them, not me. if they can’t get over this, then oh well.” and just know, you’re better and the bigger and more mature person. and even if you don’t just automatically get over it? me too. i’m still actually struggling with this. but i know that i wont have this issue forever. soon i wont care at all about this situation. maybe ill even laugh about it in the future. but if i were to continue dwelling on it and expecting everybody to just have pity for me, i probably would’ve still been in a bad space of mind too. i hope this helped anybody who needs it. 💝",2025-06-11 08:07:29,1,1,Big_Dependent7643,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l8n2cc/anybody_who_needs_to_hear_this/,True,Content Warning: Suicidal Thoughts / Self Harm,new
1l8n01i,mentalhealth,Advice for reaching out to someone I was dating who withdrew due to stress,"Okay so the background: I’ve been on a few dates with someone who I had an immediate connection with. I’m talking eyes locked from across the room, felt like being hit by a sledgehammer, friends all commented on the visible chemistry type of connection. We get on great and it has been going so well. He was, until now, showing consistent interest, initiating meeting up, and referred to us as dating. He’s made lots of mentions of things alluding a future where we are together, and isn’t seeing anyone else. We are both in our 30s and live very close to each other. 

Now, this guy is studying and has had exams approaching (they are now over as of 2 days ago) and he has been super stressed about it. Communication dropped off and the vibe was clearly different coinciding with when he started seriously knuckling down to study - I gave him the benefit of the doubt due to the timing, and he did send me an apology about seeming distant, assured me he’s still there, and told me he’s someone who withdraws completely and isolates himself when stressed/overwhelmed. He has battled anxiety and depression previously and said he’s in survival mode. I thanked him for the communication and gave him space, then his messaging dropped off a little more. I reached out to wish him luck on the day of exams, he hearted the message quickly but didn’t respond. I messaged again at the end of the day to ask how it went, he opened it but hasn’t responded in what is now a couple of days. 

To further confuse me, he watches every single one of my instagram stories very quickly. No matter how many I post, every single one, usually within the hour. He follows less than 200 people and isn’t really active on social media otherwise. 

I’ve now reached a point where I am genuinely at a loss. Normally I would immediately write off a non-response as “not interested” but given everything else, part of me still wants to give him some more time. I REALLY like this guy and could very much see it going somewhere if we can compromise on this communication issue a little bit. 

I thought I would give him another few days, maybe a week, and then send a final attempt to reach out. This is what I’m thinking: 

“Hello ☺️ am not too sure if I should keep reaching out but I thought I would give it one more attempt because I really like you. 
If you’re still having a stressful time of it then  please know I’m still here and I’d love to hear from you if/when things calm down. Maybe just 🩷 this message so I know that’s what’s going on. 
If it’s more of a “just not that interested” situation then that is a shame but it was wonderful meeting you and I hope we can be friendly if we run into each other. In that case you can spare me and just ignore this message haha. 

Regardless, I hope things are good x”

Is this okay or is it too pushy? Should I just completely leave him be and hope he eventually reaches out? If you’re someone who “goes into the cave” would you want me to reach out given the circumstances?

1l8mzxc,mentalhealth,"I (16F) need advice, I feel empty lately and I can't do anything right, idk if its laziness or smth more","I've always been a procrastinator and I'd be on social media, scrolling for long hours. Lately I feel like this has been intensified. I somehow physically can't motivate myself into trying in school. Even thought I DO care about my grades and education and understand the stakes they hold. Even with that, I ditch studying for my already procrastinated test for reels. I don't feel like doing anything whatsover and feel hopeless and useless all the time and I just really hate myself. I hate how I'm not trying, how everything can be better if I just put more effort, if I showed I cared instead of just caring. I hate my personality, my face, my body, my actions, my school, my effort, my grades, how I don't try as much as I should and go behind my parents back to just *scroll on reels* while lying and saying I'm working.

When I come back home I often just sit on my couch without showering or changing my clothes and scroll on reels mindlessly even when I have something I really need to do. I used to get really good grades, even in the beginning of the year, but now I can't even make myself TRY to do that. I always feel drained and tired and empty. I feel like a burden on my parents, they work so hard and always encourage me to try hard in school and I can't even give them that.

I'm straight up average or below average in everything I do and I don't even have some sort of talent or fun personality to compensate. I feel like my flaws overpower, such as how I get annoyed and angry easily and how I can be stubborn, hates being wrong, being argumentative, and how I find it hard to apologize even when I really want to, or even show affection. I always feel worried that everyone will turn on me, or that they secretly hate me. I also never feel like anyone's first option and the thought of it makes me feel lonely.

All my friends have other people that there just more closer too, and I feel clingy a lot. The only times I go away from my doomscrollling is to check if anyone texted me back or initiated a conversation. I do this manyyyy times too and I feel pathetic. This lasts up till around 3-4 am, sometimes even all-nighters. I don't even enjoy reels that much but it's the only thing I can make myself do.

My room is a mess, I sometimes go a few days without showering, I sleep in my bed while theres books and clothes piled upon it. I feel like barely anything makes me happy now days. I don't think I have depression as I still try biking/cleaning my room somedays as an attempt to ""claim back my life"" or ""start afresh"" or something.

My doctor said I might be developing anxiety but that was a few years ago and I think it was because of my lack of motivation to do anything despite the amount of long term goals I had and my lack of energy/being tired very often (that was anemia tho). I also don't really sleep much now days (typing this at 4 am...), and pull all nighters for no reason, like reels and yt.

I don't think I'm burnt out either as I never really overworked myself and even when my grades were good, I usually just did how much I needed to do good.

This honestly turned into a bit of a rant, but does anyone have any advice? Do I have any sort of condition? How can I fix this? Or is it just insecurities and laziness?",2025-06-11 08:02:39,1,1,No_Leather_5980,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1l8mzxc/i_16f_need_advice_i_feel_empty_lately_and_i_cant/,False,Opinion / Thoughts,new
1l8mzka,depression,I’m just existing and I don’t want to anymore,"Hello, I’m 24 and I’ve been depressed for a while now. I think it mainly stems from my self-hatred. I was anti-social for a while and still am but less so, and I thought that was the reason for my self-hatred. I think I realized it ran deeper than that. After a lot hard work, I made more friends and strengthened relationships I valued. Became a little more social. But I think I hate myself even more now. Somehow the connections I made me realize that there is so much wrong with me (my friends are all good people). People can say “there’s nothing wrong with me” but I know in my core that there is. It disgusts me. I’m revolted by my own existence. No matter how hard I can try to improve myself, nothing will change what is rotten in me. I am not a joy to be around. I can be, but it’s an act I made up. It’s a person I edited so others wouldn’t be worse off by me. While being this edited version of myself, I become very tired and sad that this is the only way people can enjoy my company or even just tolerate it. Without it, I only become a burden to everyone. I’m tired. I hate returning to my normal self and being aware of myself. I hate being alone. Even when I’m not physically alone, I still feel alone.

1l8mtqk,anxiety,Struggling with partner's anxiety,"My partner and I have been together around 3 years now, and I love them immensely. They have anxiety and I knew that going into it, and I try my absolute best to be there for them. Lately though, like the last couple of months, I've been really struggling with it and I'm not sure how to deal. 

They need a lot of reassurance, which I understand is a normal part of this condition, but recently I've been finding it hard not to get frustrated when they ask over and over if something is okay and apologize constantly- it feels like they don't trust me enough to accept my answer, and it also makes it feel like I can't talk to them if something ISN'T okay because it'll stress them out more? I know that it's not about trust and that they don't want me walking on eggshells, it's just how I've been feeling lately. 

I'm also struggling with their health. They have a lot of anxiety about their health and especially their teeth, but this anxiety manifests in avoiding taking care of themselves. I have to encourage them every day to brush their teeth and take their meds and generally look after themselves, and it's starting to get exhausting having to do that on top of looking after myself. I want to talk to them about this but don't know how to without just making it worse. 

I feel like I need more support from them but I don't know how to ask that or discuss these things without just confirming their anxiety's worst fears about being a burden. How does your partner/how would you want a partner or loved one to talk about these things with you? I love them and I'm happy to keep up the reassurances and encouragements, I just feel I can't keep doing it to the same extent at this point.

I was back in college. Not as my present day self, but as my younger self. And I think it was one of my first days in that class or something.

I sat next to some new people. Two girls and a guy. And I started talking to them. And afterwards we walked to the train station together and I asked for their social media. With the plan to keep contact.

During the talks we had fun and laughed and stuff. And I felt no fear whatsoever. It was actually pleasant to talk to and hang out with them.

It reminds me of what things were like before I had social anxiety. Back then it always felt like that.

Usually I don't care that much about having friends. It's never something I've really cared that much about, and in fact sometimes I think it can be kind of a bother. But I have to admit, having had that dream, I wish that could be reality again.

And it used to be, you know. In high school I had a friend group like that. When I first went to college I started making one before I suddenly stopped going to classes due to my anxiety spiking.

1l8mg80,anxiety,Break-Up Triggered Constant Panic and Fear – I Don’t Even Know What I’m Scared Of,"I (M24) was broken up with about two months ago by my ex (F23) after a four-year relationship. This post is not about the reasons for the break-up or whether it was right or wrong. The main focus lies in my struggle with panic and fear.

After two months, I have already done more reflecting than probably ever before in my life. I recognised that we both had a lot of struggles with ourselves, and I especially have struggled, and still struggle, with spending time alone and enjoying life on my own. I want to change that, and I see this break-up as a chance to grow, to finally love myself. Because of that, and because this break-up has been the hardest thing I have ever gone through (first relationship, therefore first break-up), I started therapy.

Right now, I still struggle a lot, and some things worry me. Before I met her and started dating her, I was not happy. Not unhappy, but I simply did not like being alone. I do not have the closest friendships, and in her, I found my best friend. Until the last day, I thought we were going to last. I would have loved to keep fighting for each other, but I know it takes two. I am not mad at her, I know we were not healthy for each other over the past year. We were struggling with problems that just did not improve. Still, it really bothers me that I still have hope, that I still wake up sometimes and look at my phone hoping for a message, that I would still take her back. I know it probably would not work in the long run, it would be way too soon, with not enough time to close our old chapter.

I know it takes time to heal, to feel alive again. I do not know why exactly, but I have so much fear, panic and anxiety inside me. That worries me a lot. Yesterday, I told my therapist that I currently see no sense in living. There is no joy. I do not think I would do anything to myself, there are too many people I would hurt. I do not want that. Still, if it were just up to me, I would not care if it all ended tomorrow. I miss the times when I wanted to live because of me, because I enjoyed life. I struggled with this even before I met her, but now it is much worse, also because I now know how happy it can feel.

The fact that I have so much anxiety, fear and panic inside me stresses me out. I do not even know what I am really afraid of, probably myself or just being lonely. I cannot stop thinking about her, about what she is doing now and so on, even though I know it does not help. I try to get better. No contact, journaling, spending time with friends, sports and allowing myself to feel. But what kind of kills me is that after an activity, which I am able to enjoy, I just fall back into feeling miserable. I do not know how I should keep going, falling asleep feeling miserable every night, waking up and thinking about her. I do not resent her, she was a good person.

I know it takes time and that it will get better. But right now, this feeling of panic and anxiety just feels unbearable. I have so much fear, and I do not even know what exactly I am afraid of. I hate the evenings, I hate going to sleep. That is when I feel the worst, the loneliest.

Can anyone relate to this fear? At the moment, everything just feels hopeless. My struggles with self-worth have come back, the feeling of not being attractive enough for someone to want me, the fear of being rejected again and not being able to handle it, the fear of never being happy again. The fear of not making it.

I’ve had time to think through out the day and it’s eating at me. I’m so scared and embarrassed.
I texted one of the friends that was there and that made me more anxious honestly.They stopped responding to me after that sent my mind into mini spiral. I made me feel like maybe I did something crazy.
I think I really embarrassed myself. I’ve never really blacked out any where besides my house.
It’s getting late now and I always felt like my anxiety gets worse at night.

1l8mdbz,bpd,Do borderlines go through change? And is it sincere?,"I was diagnosed with BPD at 17, a year and a half ago, and am currently in the rocky phase of a relationship. I don't know what to do. I made a mistake that's now caused him to be cold and distant towards me, and I just feel like shit about it. I didn't cheat on him but it was obviously a very fucked up thing to do on my end, but I took accountability for what I did and tried to fix things but it just isn't working. With the relationship being long-distance, it's just infinitely harder on me to stay stable and not lose my shit. We didn't talk for 26 hours and i stayed up counting each and every one, wondering when he'll text me. I had an episode in the middle of the night and ended up crying while texting him frantically, asking if he still loved me and still wanted to be with me. He dodged the first time i asked if he still loved me, and the second time he answered with ""I do"" only. Whereas the second question, all he responded with was ""I'll think"". I'm losing my mind because of this. I did everything I could possibly do to prove that I actually did change. I fixed my mistakes, I wrote him paragraphs explaining what happened and how guilt-ridden I felt, I made sure to be the first to text and see if he was holding up well after he didn't bother to type out a message for days. I don't know what to do. I just feel suic1dal about all of it. I even tried to break up with him but he called me mentally challenged and said, ""For the love of God don't mention my name to anyone else. You're so mentally challenged and weird it's insane. Don't bring me up when you actually do decide on ending your life (which i hope you do) because i want nothing to do with you anymore. You did this to yourself."" I'm so conflicted on what to do. I don't know if i should take his words to heart or not because every time we've argued in the past, he's said some hurtful stuff which caused me to take it personally but he always ended up apologizing and telling me he loved me, explaining how he said stuff he didn't mean in arguments because he's heated. I don't know if he means those words this time or not. I feel like I'm spiraling. I don't know how to act or what to do. I feel like I'm doubting myself and whether I can change or not. He called me annoying when I tried to call him out for not talking to me, telling me I should stop acting like a victim and that it's annoying.",2025-06-11 07:21:11,3,0,merlocy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1l8mdbz/do_borderlines_go_through_change_and_is_it_sincere/,True,💢Off My Chest/Journal Post,new

1l8m98d,depression,"No Joy, Just Panic and Emptiness - Trying to Survive After Losing Myself","I (M24) was broken up with about two months ago by my ex (F23) after a four-year relationship. This post is not about the reasons for the break-up or whether it was right or wrong. The main focus lies in my struggle with panic and fear.

After two months, I have already done more reflecting than probably ever before in my life. I recognised that we both had a lot of struggles with ourselves, and I especially have struggled, and still struggle, with spending time alone and enjoying life on my own. I want to change that, and I see this break-up as a chance to grow, to finally love myself. Because of that, and because this break-up has been the hardest thing I have ever gone through (first relationship, therefore first break-up), I started therapy.

Right now, I still struggle a lot, and some things worry me. Before I met her and started dating her, I was not happy. Not unhappy, but I simply did not like being alone. I do not have the closest friendships, and in her, I found my best friend. Until the last day, I thought we were going to last. I would have loved to keep fighting for each other, but I know it takes two. I am not mad at her, I know we were not healthy for each other over the past year. We were struggling with problems that just did not improve. Still, it really bothers me that I still have hope, that I still wake up sometimes and look at my phone hoping for a message, that I would still take her back. I know it probably would not work in the long run, it would be way too soon, with not enough time to close our old chapter.

I know it takes time to heal, to feel alive again. I do not know why exactly, but I have so much fear, panic and anxiety inside me. That worries me a lot. Yesterday, I told my therapist that I currently see no sense in living. There is no joy. I do not think I would do anything to myself, there are too many people I would hurt. I do not want that. Still, if it were just up to me, I would not care if it all ended tomorrow. I miss the times when I wanted to live because of me, because I enjoyed life. I struggled with this even before I met her, but now it is much worse, also because I now know how happy it can feel.

The fact that I have so much anxiety, fear and panic inside me stresses me out. I do not even know what I am really afraid of, probably myself or just being lonely. I cannot stop thinking about her, about what she is doing now and so on, even though I know it does not help. I try to get better. No contact, journaling, spending time with friends, sports and allowing myself to feel. But what kind of kills me is that after an activity, which I am able to enjoy, I just fall back into feeling miserable. I do not know how I should keep going, falling asleep feeling miserable every night, waking up and thinking about her. I do not resent her, she was a good person.

I know it takes time and that it will get better. But right now, this feeling of panic and anxiety just feels unbearable. I have so much fear, and I do not even know what exactly I am afraid of. I hate the evenings, I hate going to sleep. That is when I feel the worst, the loneliest.

Can anyone relate to this fear? At the moment, everything just feels hopeless. My struggles with self-worth have come back, the feeling of not being attractive enough for someone to want me, the fear of being rejected again and not being able to handle it, the fear of never being happy again.

1l8m92x,depression,I think I should end my suffering by just ending myself now.,"Hi, I'm 17M. Let me tell you my story that always hurts me. I used to have lovely childhood back then but I don't have any friends. I used to spend my time with my families especially my aunt. but things changed since I grow up. my aunt seems like avoiding me or loves more to hang out with cousin. 

When it's in school I used to be really introverted. I don't have any friends and I used to get bullied a lot until this day. Once I got bullied but this time harshly when I was 15 it really hurts me. I got post trauma about the bullying, and I also hard to recover from it. I attended a therapy once and school counselling twice but it's still feel the same. After months passed, I moved to the new school in my village. I really thought I could recover and happy there but the thing is, it's still same. I got bullied again. and again. and Today, I was rejected from the school football team because there's a good competitor. I trained so hard everyday, I tried to lose some weight and I always attended the training sessions. but it's nothing now. maybe after writing this I might just gone from this world.

1l8lzeq,bpd,I may have destroyed my marriage...(long post),"I don't know why I'm making this post other than to just vent to people who can understand and maybe get some perspective. I have been with my wife for coming up on 8 years (married for 2½). I love her more than I have ever loved anyone in my life. I was engaged to someone else before and it ended up not working out (she cheated on me as most do) and when that ended it was nothing like this. My current relationship has had it's ups and downs as most do. The ups are amazing. When we first got together it was like magic. I couldn't believe how incredible it was. In fact when we met we had both sworn off relationships altogether at that point and were just looking for some fun. After dating for a couple months we realized that we had something special. The first couple years were something else. Eventually though issues started to pop up. At this point I had never even heard of BPD so I thought I just had depression. I had been in a mental health facility for a little while years earlier but the wrote it off as major depression and medicated me accordingly. Fast forward to my current relationship and stuff started to pop up that didn't make sense to me. My girlfriend was getting really hurt by some of the stuff I was saying and the way I was treating her. I thought she it was mostly my depression and her cptsd that was causing. If she could just stop this or that then we'd be okay. I would treat her in a way that hurt her deeply and I wouldn't understand why or how to fix it. When I tried to fix it she would get more angry. I realize now that it was because I grew up in an invalidating environment so I didn't have to tools to help. I wasn't trying to understand her pain, I was trying to convince her that what she was hurt about wasn't reality. That she was just looking at things wrong or misunderstood how I felt or was overreacting about something. This usually ended with her more upset and me disassociating because I didn't know how to fix it. Then there were the other times when she would go out with friends and I would have these crazy thoughts about what she was doing and why. I would lose my shit and start texting her in these barrages to get her to respond which would only make her feel unsafe and not want to come home. This would trigger me because now she's disappeared off the map and I'm flipping the fuck out. I couldn't tell what was real and what's wasn't. These instances caused her a lot of anxiety just in general about our relationship. She would feel like she had to walk on eggshells all the time because she didn't know what was going to trigger me. I didn't know what was going to trigger me. There were instances of self harm that would freak her out. There were mood swings out of nowhere. All the classics brought to you by untreated BPD. Until one day I happened across a video about BPD and I could swear the guy was talking about me specifically. Everything he said was so accurate to my life it was almost like a biography. I then talked to my therapist about it and she said it sounds like this might have be what I have however she didn't want to do a formal diagnosis because I was thinking and trying to get custody of my kid from my previous partner and it might look bad. That was about a year or so ago. When I first found out about this diagnosis I didn't know what the fuck to think. I was confused and kind of angry that on top of all the other bullshit I've had to go through in life, now I have this horrible disorder. It felt almost like a death sentence in a way. It took me maybe six months to really process it. All the while my mental health was deteriorating. I work from home so I'm isolated all day. I stopped drinking so I lost most of my friends. My band broke up so no musical outlet anymore. Things were getting worse and worse between my (now) wife and I. It got to a point where it wasn't sustainable anymore and I needed to make a change. So I started reading more and more about BPD. As I did this I started having all these realizations about how why I feel the way I feel and where it's coming from. I started to figure out how to climb out of this hole and start making changes. Well this was a could months ago and mid May my wife and I had an argument and I said some really hurtful shit and she stormed off. After that she started treating me differently. I could feel the love drying up and withering away. I didn't know why at the time, I just knew something was really wrong. I asked her if she still loved me and she said yes. This went on for weeks. A couple weeks ago it got to the point where it was so painful to be without this love that I sat in the basement alone crying for a couple hours. I came upstairs and laid in bed just crying to myself because I knew something was really really wrong and I could feel the love missing. My wife comes in and gets angry with me because I was ignoring everyone in the house. I told her I don't think she loves me anymore and are starts listing off reasons why she's upset with me. This hurt a lot and I got defensive. Things got heated and she said she wants a divorce. I was crushed. I told her to reconsider but she said her mind was made up. I spent the next couple days pretty much incapacitated with grief. I didn't work or shower or eat, pretty much just laid in bed crying like a little girl. She wanted me out of the house so I flew out of state to stay with my parents for a few days. While I was away I did a lot of reflecting and realized how awful I had been to her. I went back through old text conversations and was horrified by how I had treated her. I started to see things in a whole new light. I was the villain. I hurt her so much that it finally broke her capacity to love me back. When she eventually started to speak to me again I told her how I realized that she was right all this time and how sorry I am for what I've done to her. Over the last couple weeks we have had many conversations about issues in the past and I have taken responsibility for my actions but she doesn't trust me now. She thinks that I'm just saying this to keep her from leaving. And then she said that even if I have had this realization that it's only because I stand to lose something and that I didn't really care until then. I came to the conclusion that I have always cared but I just never knew how to help her in her time of me because I didn't know how. When I failed to help I felt powerless and are would get upset because of my invalidating behavior so I would disassociate and usually go to sleep while she stayed up crying by herself. I really fucked up and I don't know if it can be fixed. What really gets me is how much I have hurt her and made her feel like I never really loved her and that she is unlovable due to something about her. I'm trying to sit with her in these feelings now and understand her better. She is just having a hard time believing that I really feel this way and I'm not just saying what she wants to here and I understand why she feels that way. We're in this weird situation now where we're technically separated but still living together and sleeping in the same bed but she has this wound that I don't know if it can be healed. We are kind of stuck in routine and she still says I love you and hugs me before she goes to work but there is an odd energy and a frequent anger from her. God I feel so horrible for what I did to her. I feel like a monster for hurting the person I vowed to protect and cherish forever so damn much. This is the worst pain and hardest thing I've ever had to do. I have started on a path to treatment but it might be too little too late. It feels like vacuuming the carpet in a house that's burning down. If she's gone I don't know how I'm going to continue on in life. After knowing the love and closeness of my wife and best friend I don't know how I can ever go home to an empty apartment. I don't know how I can let go of the thought of living our lives together and getting old together. Not having her as an adventure partner around the world. Not watching her do all the little endearing things I watch her so every day like braid her hair on the edge of the bed before we go to sleep or hearing her sing through the house. Missing the smell of her perfume or just her smell in general. Or the warmth and weight of her next to me in bed. Fuck. I really fucked this one up bad and I don't know how to fix it. I've been on the crisis hotline several times this last week because she takes off all night because she needs to be away from me and I don't know how to deal with it. I wish I could take all the horrible things I said back. I wish I could show myself back then the damage I was doing. I regret this more than anything I have ever done. Most of all I regret causing her so much pain. I can see it on her face. I can see where the love is missing and how I made her feel broken. I don't know if either of us will ever be the same and it's all my fault...",2025-06-11 06:55:49,1,0,tech_noir_guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1l8lzeq/i_may_have_destroyed_my_marriagelong_post/,False,:gemma: General Post,new

1l8kwex,bpd,Whyyyyy??,"I left my ex 2.5 years ago. He was abusive in every way. I now have CPTSD now - along with BPD. It's made like difficult. Before my ex, I was so codependent. He destroyed me so much I enjoy being alone more than offering my energy enough to get hurt anymore.

After leaving. I have turned down everyone who has tried. Accept, one. He is amazing. He is talented. Reassuring. Patient. Honest. Intelligent. He is like my missing puzzle piece. Like, God made him for me. I love him, who he is, how unique he is, how devoted & loyal he is. He would give me the same amount of love I would. 

He is able to give me what I have always wanted. Yet, I can't now. My whole life has known trauma. I finally left my ex and found self-love. Apparently, it is so much that I enjoy being alone. Maybe it's fear? I'm unsure. 

Needless to say, I was an idiot. I pushed him away. He kept trying, and trying, I would not even look at the messages or answer calls. I dont even know why. I do have a lot going on in my life (with packing, moving, unpacking, deep cleaning, selling the house, divorce, custody battle, and so much more) which - has sent me into this frantic emotional state. Way easily stressed & reactive. 

Literally, he did nothing wrong. If I felt hurt by something, he validated, apologized, and changed the behavior. Like?? How does someone like this exist? I never go for green flags. I have always been a bull chasing red flags. That's why I haven't dated. Naturally, with me distancing. He did the same today he didnt read anything I sent the entire day. I felt upset that he did the same thing I did - except. It was the first day he did this.  Every day before that, he's shown he wants this... so what do I do?? I deleted him off snap! 🥺 WHYYY? I tried to talk myself out of it before I did. I tried to talk sense into myself that he is only doing the same thing you've done the past 3-4 weeks (each week I got more distant). I got the feeling in my stomach & I couldn't talk myself out of it.  

Now I feel like an idiot for pushing the green flag away. The one man who got my attention did everything right. He is so talented, and OMG, he is so attractive... here I am unsure how to take it back.. I know I screwed up & now maybe I lost him forever.

Maybe it's for the best. He deserves more than the push pull of my BPD. He deserves more than having to deal with the trauma I hold with my past relationship & life experiences. He deserves more than who I become in a relationship. I get reserved. Feel trapped. Scared. Jealous. Depressed. Needy. Insecure. When he pulls away & I run back. I want him, the future it would be with him. Yet - my brain, heart, and body feel like they never align.. 

Idk how to explain it to him. I want him, but he is better off without what being with me entails. I'm too damaged now. I just dont know how to explain this & know I can't apologize & promise that I won't do it again. Because I can say I won't & will aim to never do it. But, my self sabotaging would take over at one point & break the promise. 

I dont want to hurt. I dont want anyone to hurt. I especially do not want to hurt him. ",2025-06-11 05:43:54,3,3,Honeybadger4eva,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1l8kwex/whyyyyy/,False,Acted Opposite to Emotion,new
1l8ko1a,socialanxiety,Sensitivity to rejection is reaching a boiling point,"I’ve always had this obsessive fear of rejection/others’ opinions. I’m obsessed with being a “good” person according to the standards of others. I have never been evaluated by a professional, so I am not formally diagnosed with any mental disorder. But I know something is very, very wrong with me. I feel like if people don’t like me, then whats the point of living. If I do anything bad or evil, then my right to be respected as a human is completely nullified and I’m basically just a wild animal that needs to be put down. 

Heres a less serious example: if a popular music critic or a close friends says something really harsh about a band I like, I will internalize that as if I’m not allowed to like that band or this person would hypothetically hate me. I’ll shove my shirts to the back of my closet, remove all their albums from my Spotify, never listen to them again even if I like them. If I see someone wearing their shirt, or hear their song on the radio, I will  disassociate and go into this anxious state. I will repeat that critic or friends’ criticisms in my head over and over and over again for like five or ten minutes. And then maybe two years later or something I’ll finally gather up enough courage to listen to them in my own bedroom again. This is just using something as silly as music taste. Imagine how bad it is with real issues…..

This doesn’t mix well with the fact that my mother is a very passionate Zionist and my father voted for Trump (he’s not a full on MAGA cult member and rarely talk about politics, but still). I won’t be financially independent for a while, at least not for another year. So instead, I have just been mentally beating myself up. I feel like all my friends and a lot of other people would completely hate me if they knew who my parents were. I’m such a disgusting and evil excuse for a human being because I have to live under the same roof as these monsters. Every time my mom or dad tell me they love me I feel this deep pit in my stomach. I sometimes wish they would die. I love them abd they sacrificed so much to raise me, but the cognitive dissonance and the anxiety is too much for me to handle. If they were just gone some of that guilt would go away. I literally just want them gone because I’m so scared and terrified of hypothetical rejection from my little punk-rock clique and activists on TikTok. I want to stop feeling like this but I can’t help it. 

Not gonna lie, I have fallen into suicidal thoughts over this multiple times. I have dipped back into them tonight because of the protests happening in my city. All my friends are rightfully furious and calling for violence. I feel like I have zero right to be by their side. No matter what I do, I have to come back home to my evil parents  my parents fit the bill for the people that they say deserve violence, and I do too, simply by association. Simply by living with them and sharing their blood. My friends obviously won’t kill me or my parents, and these are just things they say in their Instagram stories, but the fundamental philosophy that my life is worthless still sticks with me. I live with oppressors and I don’t deserve life or to be treated as human, and I should rid society of my presence.

1l8jtq3,therapy,Need advice,"I'm 35F. I have been married for three years but we have been together since I was 17. We have two kids together. Our relationship has been really tough the last two years. A lot of arguing and thing said that shouldn't be. One night I woke up to him trying to have sex with me. I immediately freaked out, he apologized but it happened a few more times. Now I have all this hate towards him and we haven't been intimate in months. What he doesn't know and what no one knows is when I was 15 I stayed at a friends house and we had boys over that were a couple years older and we all drank I woke up to one of the boys on top of me having sex with me, I freaked out pushed him off and he left. I never told anyone, he would still text me like we were friends de but I never spoke to hi. Again. So when my husband did this to me it brought me right back to that moment. I haven't shared that with him because of how our fights have been and I don't ever want it brought up or thrown in my face because it's so traumatic and I haven't spoken this to anyone ever. Not a friend, family not a soul knows. I just don't know what to do now, I don't know if I can ever forgive my husband or if I am taking out all of this on him and maybe he didn't mean or think he was doing anything wrong and because of what I've been through I am letting all my anger out on him.

Since I’ve been repeatedly instructed to start seeing an ocd specialist, I’ve began to look. I looked at psychology today and iocdf. I found 2 whole clinics dedicated to OCD, including one in my city, but both of them explicitly state that they do not take insurance and are private pay only. I cannot do that. I can’t work, I have ergophobia and my crippling work fear is the exact thing I’m trying to treat in the first place. My mom is a single mom, the sole provider between the 3 of us and is almost always tight on cash. 

I found a third provider who does ERP and takes our insurance but her office is 20 minutes away. I cannot drive, my mom cannot take 40 minutes out of her workday to drive me there and pick me up, 40 minute uber drive is going to be very expensive, and I cannot do telehealth as I always get distracted and the counselors don’t feel interested. Everything seems hopeless. Should I just stick with my current counselor who plans on focusing on positive experiences with working and told me to seek out posts from people who enjoy their jobs and find it fulfilling?",2025-06-11 00:44:45,2,3,NacreousSnowmelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1l8fdl3/why_dont_any_ocd_specialists_take_insurance_andor/,False,Vent / Rant,new

Examples are yelling, cussing in my face, coming up behing me, whispering my name behind me, childen screaming because parents abuse them in front of me. I also have a special needs son and I asked before I was hired to have a specific lunch  break so I could put my son to bed over the phone. I work evenings and asked for 8pm lunch breaks. We are constanly overstaffed and the managers aways go MIA. My lunches are always atleast an hour late if not 2. And no bosses around to tell them or ask them about my lunch. This has all effected me VERY badly and my son. I did talk to my hiring manager which is the head person over cashiers/customer service. I cried and explained my ptsd and my needs my son has. Btw I told him I was a veteran and about my son during the interview. He told me he would change me departments and talk to the managers about my needs and that they needed to step it up in their jobs. He did talk to another department manager and the managers in charge. I was supposed to get placed in grocery within 2 weeks. I felt like I was barely holding on mentally but I agreed and let him try to find someone else to replace me. Its now been a month. The managers and my lunches have not changed or gotten better and I still havent been moved to different department. I cant mentally take this, I get ptsd fog everyday during work and it lingers into my home life. My son isnt adapting well since I can never call him while hes awake.

1l8b28i,ptsd,Advice for a struggling partner,"Hello everyone,

I'm (33m) looking for advice to help my partner (34f). She has probable AuDHD, POTS and CPTSD which leaves finding information on these a bit tricky.

90% of the time we are great, but every once in a while we will have a huge argument. This normally involves her listing off how I am similar to her ex and that I don't support her emotionally. 

Trying to talk it out as I apologise and try to explain only leads up down the arguement route. Normally ending up her refusing to sleep in our bed, planning our break up or making plans without me. 

Normally we are ok by the end of next day. I stay up late and ask her to come bed eventually we will and we sleep for a couple of hours, wake up and start our day awkwardly. 

While I take my fair share of the blame as I normally trigger her when she is already on the brink of a meltdown. E.g I have ADHD so my constant dopamine searches can be seen as dismissal or ignoring our friends. 

I try and massage her daily and I do all the chores, although when I'm tired this sometimes also triggers her slightly. I read a lot about autism and pots and try and help with this.

She has in the past said that I have to just ride the storm out as she knows what she says is hurtful.

When I try and explain myself using 'I' focuses, this triggers her CPTSD, if I give her space to cooldown, triggers CPTSD.

I love her oh so very much, and I hate triggering her but any additional advice to assist so I can either smoothly resolve the argument or anything I haven't considered regarding triggering her would be greatly appreciated.

If you have any questions, I will try and answer them asap :)

1g4e5ld,bpd,you don’t have bpd you are 12,"ADDING CLARIFICATION RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THIS POST SO LITERACY STOPS GOING OUT THE WINDOW:
i am not saying minors shouldn’t seek therapy or mental help, i am not saying self diagnosis is bad, i am not saying there aren’t young people with bpd, i am not saying bpd symptoms can’t show that early, i am not saying there has never been someone under 18 to be diagnosed and i am for sure not saying that these children are perfectly okay and don’t need help


i have noticed an influx of posts made by extremely young individuals and i would like to say 

i understand you are having a hard time, i understand emotions are not easy to deal with 

but i need you to understand, bpd is a complex disorder, and no there isn’t a way we can help  you get diagnosed, no advice we can give you will help, underage people only get diagnosed with bpd in EXTREMELY special circumstances 

you have to be 18 to be diagnosed with bpd and some professionals don’t even recommend that and instead recommend waiting till you’re 20,  you’re brain is not developed enough to know for sure wether it is the complex illness of bpd or simply the complex illness of pubescent hormones

bpd traits diagnosis is reserved for those who are suspected of bpd but cannot yet get a diagnosis due to age and development, but even then your psych might go back on that and say no i messed up you don’t have bpd, ive seen it happen many times.

the point im trying to make here is, a lot of these posts made by underage individuals seem to perpetuate the stigma already put out by neurotypicals, and often i see young people asking for help to be diagnosed, 
and to be blunt you do not have bpd and posting about how you are an abusive individual and need to get diagnosed is not helping anybody including yourself and is damaging to a community you are not yet even part of, sometimes it’s okay to wait your turn and take your time and when it comes to posts like that and posts where you are giving other people advice, it would be best to wait on that, obviously be apart of the discussion but starting a preface of “i have bpd” when you maybe don’t is destructive 

tldr;
there are a lot of minors on this sub posting about how they HAVE bpd when there is only a 50% chance they actually do, and they are posting harmful stigmatizing posts.


edit: i was diagnosed the second i turned 18, they knew i had it but followed local guidelines, i was being treated for it since i was 14, i did DBT therapy 4 times before i turned 20 it did help me not have extreme behaviours as an adult. 
the point of this post is to not discourage getting mental help, you should definitely go to a therapist and receive help regardless of if you do or do not have bpd, the point of this post is that people who aren’t diagnosed shouldn’t be leading discussions and directing answers to others on what they potentially do not have",2024-10-15 18:04:57,1726,432,duckiewucky,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1g4e5ld/you_dont_have_bpd_you_are_12/,False,💢Venting Post,top
1fnbusu,counseling,Looking for advice,"I’ve also posted this in another group, just trying to get some anonymous feedback before proceeding. 

So this may be a word vomit so bear with me…

Going back to 2008, I was active duty in the Marine Corps and about to go on my 4th deployment. Just had a bad breakup with someone and a friend hooked me up with her sister a month and a half before leaving to cheer me up. 

We seemed to click at the time, had a blast and of course had sex a few times, I didn’t think too much of it at the time except that it was well needed after the breakup. 

She seemed cool and we stayed in contact as I left for the deployment. But here’s the plot twist…

Month one: messaging normally and finding out she’s recently divorced, no big deal. 

Month two: finding out she’s pregnant, excited and through constant messaging, feelings are coming around. 

Month three: more messaging, things are good. 

Month four: my family gets involved, she meets my mom and sister, and they go to an 4d ultrasound. Getting excited. 

Month five: the ball drops, she isn’t divorced, but they are separated. Then find out they aren’t separated but going to counseling. 

Month six: (this is the bad month) they never did any of that, they had been married for 10 years and the baby is his and not to message back. That didn’t seem right to me, something was off about it. 

After not killing myself while I was in Iraq (almost did it) I start to message my friend to get some back story. Well, come to find out, they couldn’t have kids because the guy was sterile (he was Navy and worked on nukes I guess). They had this planned and I couldn’t do anything about it. My friend knew none of this and this turned out to be a big family issue with them on top of what this is with me. 

 I get home a couple months later and my friend confides in me that the kid born was in fact mine. Lots of things were going through my head because I had always wanted kids. My dad had passed and I was the only boy so knowing I now had a son out there was a big deal. They were in another state and the husband got wind of me knowing what I knew and contacted me threatening me with getting in trouble for sleeping with a married woman (something the military will actually punish you for). 

At the time, I decided that the child was at least being raised by a family, they had the kids best interest at hand since they went through that kind of trouble. This was years ago so I can’t remember 100% where my mind was. But I told my friend that I’d always be there if I was ever needed for anything, medical history, support for something, whatever. 

This was in 2008, the boy was born in November. Now another plot twist is while staying in touch with my friend, I find out the husband gets killed in 2015 in a motorcycle accident. Again I reach out through the friend but am still stonewalled by the girl. No support wanted, no contact, whatever. Come to find out, after leaving the military, the company he worked for had a good benefits package and was still going to continue to cover her and her son. Seeing as he’s good, I continue to hold my position. 

While all of this is going on by the way, I got married and now have two kids of my own. 

The friend reached out to me when the boy was roughly 12 asking a little about family history, but nothing more. Little info I get here and there, finding out I think she remarried and whatnot. The boy is about to be 16 now and while I don’t want to ruin his life, I just wish I had some type of connection to my first born (that apparently looks just like me). 

Am I wrong or an ass for wanting that? Legally am I about to awaken a shitstorm on myself? I have all the saved conversations showing I was willing and ready at all times to take my responsibility.

utu7v0,selfhelp,30 mental models that will make you more successful in life,"Mental models are magical.

Once you learn one, you start seeing it everywhere. It changes your thinking forever.

They make you understand the world and human nature better.

Here are 30 of them with their short explanations:

# 1. Antifragility   

We know fragile things. They break easily with a little stress and disorder. 

Antifragile things don’t just resist a shock, damage, or crisis but also thrive under these conditions. It’s a concept developed by Nassim Taleb in his book Antifragile.  


https://preview.redd.it/wumdik5ifm091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=100b86894b1dbab7c47660531a563c289a7484b5

# 2. Redundancy  

Efficiency brings hidden risks. Not only for supply chains but also for your life.   

Redundancy is not only insurance when the crisis comes, but also a way to benefit from it.  

Extra cash, multiple income streams, and survival skills are good examples.

# 3. Input Goals   

Most of the goals you set are output goals, based on outcomes (becoming a millionaire or getting a six-pack).   

But the outcomes are never under your control.   

Focus on input goals to achieve your goals.  


https://preview.redd.it/8b9sd0orfm091.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4393e847340aaaabf0141aa4db1c40e16ea890a

&#x200B;

# 4.  Information Arbitrage   

Everybody has specific knowledge that they can leverage by trading or using it.   

Information Arbitrage is benefitting from the knowledge gap between you and others.

# 5.  Fosbury Flop:   

Dick Fosbury changed the high jump when he rejected to listen to people who say “We’ve always done it this way.”   

He looked for a better way and invented his own style (jumping backward) to dominate the high jump. 

What can be your Fosbury Flop?

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/aiyvj1hyfm091.gif

&#x200B;

# 6. Exponential Thinking   

Our brains think incrementally by default.   

But as Astro Teller Said: “It’s usually easier to make something 10x better than it is to make it 10% better.”

# 7. Minimum Viable Product   

You define what is the minimum, what is viable, and what is the product before starting working on a project.   

It’s a common practice in software development.   

But, it's applicable in different aspects of your life to avoid perfectionism.

# 8. The 5/25 Rule   

List the 25 things you want to achieve.   

Decide on the 5 most important ones from the list.   

Now you have 5 goals that you’ll focus on this year.   

What will you do with the rest? You’ll avoid them **at all costs**.

# 9. Compartmentalization   

Napoleon’s secret to handling many complex topics with full attention.   

It’s not multitasking; it’s extreme **unitasking**.

# 10. Resistance   

Steven Pressfield’s villain from his book The War of Art.   It’s a force inside you that would like to keep things the same. You feel it whenever you’d like to do something useful.   It shows its face in the form of procrastination, fear, or anxiety.

# 11. The 80/20 Rule

20% of the causes create 80% of the outcomes.  

Identify 20% of the activities that give you 80% of the results.  

If it’s a positive outcome activity (investments) focus on that 20%.  

If it’s negative (causes of stress, bad health) eliminate that 20%.

# 12. Leverage   

Leverage —as a concept— is getting the maximum output with the same resources.   

As [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval) says, the modern world gives us two magical (and cheap) tools to use leverage: code and media.  

Labor and money are two other forms of leverage.

# 13. The Snowball Effect   

The power of compounding. Money, effort, and knowledge compound in the long term in ways you cannot imagine.  

You can get the benefits of the snowball effect only if you're patient and don't interrupt the snowball’s momentum.

Warren Buffett's net worth is a great example:

# 14. Second-Order Thinking   

Every decision has consequences. But consequences also have consequences.   

Second-order thinking is evaluating not only the apparent first-order consequences; but the events that can occur following them.

https://preview.redd.it/75njk5lhgm091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab9e668ff11951c52da55640f4cd5f2186206a2f

&#x200B;

# 15. Inverse Thinking   

When options are broad, making the right decision is hard.   

Inverse thinking makes it easier by **avoiding the negative**.   

So instead of: “What should I do to be happy in my life?” Ask: “What are the things that would make my life miserable?"" And avoid them.

# 16. Regret Minimization Framework  

Jeff Bezos’ mental model to make big life decisions. Before founding Amazon he projected himself as 80 years old.   

Would his old self regret not joining the internet wave and selling books online?   

After this framing, the decision was easy.

# 17. Via Negativa  

As Nassim Taleb puts it solution through **subtraction**.   

Instead of looking for things to add to a system, a project, or your life, you look for things to eliminate.   Want to improve your health?   

Don’t buy supplements; remove smoking, sugar, and drinking first.

# 18. A-B-Z Framework  

Having a long-term goal for yourself is good.   

But it's overwhelming when you think about how to get there.   

So instead: Assess where you are (A), set your direction (Z), and decide on your immediate next step (B).   Take that action.

# 19. Personal SWOT Analysis   

SWOT is a tool that executives use to have situational awareness of their companies: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  

Personal SWOT **paints a picture of your life** and allows you to find the best path for yourself.  


https://preview.redd.it/pzn2d5jwgm091.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af82b40bbd208fe6c33f1177e52f5cfc352646eb

# 20. 10-10-10 Rule   

Ask how you’ll feel about a decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years.   

Makes your decision easier by showing you some of the second-order effects.

# 21. Halo Effect   

People do judge a book by its cover.  

If you experience something positive at first (nice packaging of a product or well-dressed person), you intuitively have a better feeling about **all other aspects** of that brand or person.

It's one of Apple's marketing principles. That's why they've been paying attention to **all details** of the brand; the packaging of iPhones, the design of its stores, and new product presentations…

# 22. Commitment Bias   

Your mind tries to be consistent with your past actions and words.   

So people get stuck with ideas, investments, or business decisions that don’t make sense anymore.   

Only because they had committed to them with their money, effort, or words.

# 23. Hindsight Bias   

After we know how things turned out, our minds ignore all other possibilities and explain the past as it was inevitable.   

Plus it creates false confidence.   

People think if it’s easy to explain all past events they can also predict the future.

https://preview.redd.it/j5h8b072im091.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e538116b9cd0ef7860877cedd31dfd72ac8345

&#x200B;

# 24. Concorde Fallacy   

Thinking like a losing gambler. 

People allow the **past cost** of something to influence their decisions today.   

Concorde project was a great example of it: the British and French governments continued to spend billions on the project despite its obvious flaws.

https://preview.redd.it/643b2a65im091.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d35b747f0b84cdafff2056b3a4cbd3ac556c40ce

# 25. The Paradox of Choice   

After a certain level, each additional option makes your decision harder.   

More becomes less. Only limitations can help you to break it.   

It’s heavily used in marketing by reducing the options of potential customers.

# 26. Lindy Effect   

As we get older, we have less time to live.   

But ideas don’t have a life span. So the older an idea, a technology or a company gets, the longer it will live in the future. It’s **aging in reverse**.   

Examples: wheel (technology), Sun Tzu (ideas), and Coca-Cola (company).

# 27. Goodhart’s Law   

“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”   

Example: A support agent is incentivized for the results of a survey, not for the actual customer satisfaction.   

So an agent might be pushy —hence reducing satisfaction— to get more survey responses from customers.

# 28. Argumentum Ad Populum  

Latin for “appeal to the people.” 

It's a fallacy when people accept what is popular as true without logical reasoning.   

“University education is necessary for success.” is an example.   

We take it from society without thinking it through ourselves.

# 29. Parkinson’s Law  

Projects expand to fill the time available for their completion.   

So even if the project with a two-week deadline could be finished in three days, you’d still tend to use all the time you have.   

And the additional time wouldn’t even improve the quality.

# 30. The 10/1 Rule   

For every active social media account on any platform, there are around 9 passive accounts.   

It means whatever your skills and interests are, the moment you start actively sharing; you leave 90% of people behind in your area.

soo51t,bpd,The best way I’d describe BPD is,"You feel like you are a child who was forcibly put in an adult body. It’s like you missed 10 years of your life and you’ve landed in a position where emotionally you don’t have the tools to survive. You don’t understand the responsibilities you have nor can you confront them. 
You’re constantly going after immediate gratification; even though you’ll know it may land you in trouble later.

Emotions are hard. You are extremely reactive. You cry so easily and every little inconvenience feels like the end of the world. You create havoc when things don’t go your way because you don’t know how to control your emotions.
You do understand nuance in the world, but your brain can’t but just categorize people and things as black or white.

The world is extremely boring. More often than not, you feel like you’re missing out on something special. An adventure. An opportunity. But you’re paralyzed by the fact that you feel powerless and so damn empty all the time.

You just want to be loved and cared for. But you lack the emotional stability to return the affections properly. Just like a kid who is loved by their mom, only by virtue of being her child, you want such an extreme connection with someone else. You want to feel inherently special to someone. But sometimes you end up unwillingly taking more than you can give.
Being alone hurts, you feel abandoned. You feel like you’ll never be cared for again. But just a show of affection can completely change your mood and brighten your day.


You love to make people happy. You see the good in everyone. You just want acceptance in this world. You want to find your niche, your identity, your clique. You want someone to tell you it’s okay. Everything is okay. And that everything will be fine. 
The monster beneath the bed is not real. The monster inside the closet is not real. 
But there’s nobody to tell you that. Nobody can understand your irrational fears, because they expect you to act like a grown up and “to stop being so dramatic”. They think you do it on purpose or that you lack self-restraint.
But you don’t wish harm. You do want to do better. You want to be helped. Held. And taught how to live. You want someone to be patient with you, because growing up and learning how to live is not easy.
You just want to be treated warmly and helped by the very world who stopped you from emotionally maturing. By those you stunted your growth, but now expect you to act like a proper adult.",2022-02-09 21:14:04,1927,144,piksoulet,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/soo51t/the_best_way_id_describe_bpd_is/,False,Input,top

n9d8k0,selfhelp,For all men who think their lives suck,"&#x200B;

22M here. Straight to the point, basically I used to be a piece of shit. I was who would sit around all day, playing videogames, smoking weed with friends and constantly jerking off to porn, yeah I know, a lot of self-deprecating behaviours. All these things messed up my head, specially porn and masturbation after years of doing it, I thought it was all ok. I also think this has a lot to do with our modern society that normalizes certain behaviours that shouldn't be normalized, ""it's normal to do PMO"", ""it's normal to smoke weed"" etc. But that's just my personal opinion, also at the end of the day it's your choice. I was basically a stoned incel xD. Over this years I had a few chances with girls (because according to what people tell me I'm conventionally attractive) that I wasted because I could never take the next step, cause deep down I guess I knew my value was really low, and my self-esteem simply didn't exist.

Finally after years of degrading routines I realised something was wrong with me and I needed to change. I just asked myself, ""what type of person do you want to be in this life?"". I started watching some self-development youtube videos, learned a lot about it, then started to put my knowledge in practice. Trust me, it's not that hard. Just replace bad habits with good habits. Nowadays, I haven't smoked weed in 3,5 months, I'm 5 months pornfree and I pratice NoFap, still relapse sometimes but never to porn, I will never watch that shit again. It makes you have a wrong idea of what sex should be and makes you see women as sexual objects. I started to workout and now I'm in better shape than I've ever been, started meditations and cold showers, found a job that I like to do, I'm finishing my degree and I'm starting a low budget online business. Also I recently lost my virginity and it was an amazing experience, the feeling of intimacy was great and it had nothing to do with what porn shows. After all this months I feel so amazing with all this progress.

If I did it, you can do it too! I will leave some tips for your self development journey:

1- Be honest with yourself and analyze your situation to see where you're at right now.

2- Think deeply about your habits and try to remove the bad ones, even if progressively (deep down everyone knows what's good and what's bad)

3- Start your fitness journey (set goals first)

4- Start meditating everyday for at least 5-10min and try to start cold-showers (gives you energy)

5- Dress well and style yourself (looks do matter)

6- If you masturbate to porn, stop right now. That shit fucks your dopamine receptors and rewires your brain over time. It's ok to masturbate sometimes but never with porn. Retaining your semen will give you more energy and confidence, try it out and see.

7- Read about self-development and stoicism (this helped me a lot)

8- Only worry about what you can control, worrying about things that you can't control is a waste of time, only care about what you can improve. For example, don't worry about your height or anything genetic, I'm a short dude (176cm/5""9) and I give zero fucks about it, because there's nothing I can do to change it.

9- Screw instant gratification, think about the future.

10- Turn your passions into hobbies

11- If you are boring with nothing to do, go do some research. Serioulsy, go learn something new, or just do a workout.

12- Don't be afraid to disagree and speak your mind, stand up for your values

13- Control your urges and emotions, think rationally. Sometimes you can't control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to it. Try to not allow your feelings to control your actions (this one is really hard and I myself still fail at it sometimes). Not saying you have to be a unsensitive asshole, but establish a bareer between allowing yourself to feel and allowing your feelings to control you.

14- Don't let the external control your internal.

15- Prioritize yourself. When you say yes to someone, make sure you aren't saying no to yourself.

Do all of this things (and a lot more), and I promise you will see a difference. It won't be easy at the beggining because humans hate to change and like comfort zones, but think about it, its for a better future. For you!. These are some of the habits and exercises I could remember but there are many more. You'll see a difference in your self respect and also in the way people approach and speak to you. Why this works? Because when you have good habits you are telling your subconscious brain that you have respect for yourself, that's how self-esteem works in my opinion.

Note: Be confident, not arrogant! No need to be an asshole.",2021-05-10 19:06:18,393,92,None,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/n9d8k0/for_all_men_who_think_their_lives_suck/,False,,top

n0y195,anxiety,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today.

m7lj0y,selfhelp,"I feel like I've lost myself, my personality, and my love for life","I’m having an issue that I believe will probably be relatable to some people. Lately, I feel like i’ve lost all my sense of identity and personality. it has stemmed from a massive loss of confidence and i have begun to question everything about myself and whether or not i’ve ever been the ‘real me’. i’m sure a lot of these feelings are attributed to depression and whilst this is something i am aware and have accepted that i have, i simply cannot accept the fact that it has sucked away my entire personality. i wouldn’t go as far as saying i was the ‘life of the party’ but i was certainly always an outgoing person. Anyone that knows me (or knows who i used to be) would say that i am confident and happy and constantly adding spark to conversations. however, now, i have to painstakinly think before i say anything, to anyone, even my family. every sentence is a prejudged line and nothing flows naturally anymore. i am uncomfortable when there is silence and always blame it on myself if there is an awkward moment in a conversation and think that it wouldn't be awkward if I wasn’t there. i have this big need to be intersting and different and someone who people love and want to be around. i am so unhappy with myself and genuinely have no idea of brings me joy anymore. this leaves me having to seek joy from external factors such as others. validation is something i heavily rely on to an extent that I wasn’t even aware of until i began to realise that spurts of happiness i would have from receiving a nice message from someone. i don’t recognise myself like this and i am so afraid of my friends seeing me like this that i don’t message or talk to anyone for days. i hate doing this because i know isolating myself like this just makes me feel more alone and whilst my friends care and want to be there for me, i know it’s hard to be there for someone who barely gives so little back. i fear that i have fallen so deep into this mindset that i will never be able to find my true self again. all i want is some confidence and hope so i can start rebuilding the real me, not some false facade that i put on to seem ok. i want to be real, raw, authentic and happy. i know this isn’t something that will come overnight but it’s killing me that i stray further and further away from myself everyday. ",2021-03-18 07:25:37,627,135,eeyoressaddercousin,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/m7lj0y/i_feel_like_ive_lost_myself_my_personality_and_my/,False,,top

“Your existence is a valid one, and I don’t want you to feel like you’re burdening me by sharing what you’re going through. I haven’t known you long but the fact you don’t feel that the world is brighter and warmer with you in it is very...it’s sad to me.”

fkshe6,selfhelp,I feel like everybody is better than me and I hate it and can't compete,"I'm so tired of it. Every moment from the time I wake up until I go to sleep, I just feel like I'm not enough, constantly comparing myself to something or someone. 

I get jealous when my friends for the tiniest things (finishing a book that I had difficulty with), scoring a higher test score, getting into better schools, or I compare myself to some arbitrary person that's successful. Everything from physical health, to education, to intelligence, to hobbies, I have the impending urge to be better than those around me, and I always feel inadequate because someone around me is better. 

When I see someone doing better than me, I get irrationally angry and if they're my friends, then I start saying things to undermine them, make them angry, in order to get control and make myself feel as if I have power over them in order to feel superior. And then I just feel awful because I hurt their feelings and then I feel like a total piece of shit, and I just beat myself up more, telling myself that I'm pathetic.

I've been trying to stop feeling like this, but HOW? I know I *should* stop comparing myself to other people, but I can't, i'm just constantly doing it regardless of whether I think about it or not.

dspuar,bpd,The reality of BPD,"Borderline Personality Disorder isn’t being cute and ‘clingy’ and ‘adorably needy’. Being with (romantic or otherwise) someone with BPD isn’t akin to taking care of a pet. BPD isn’t an ‘aw it’s so endearing that they need me so badly’ type of thing. 

BPD is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and it’s not easy to diagnose. You don’t just decide you have it, just like you don’t decide you’re depressed because you had a bad  day, or you don’t decide you’re bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes. Believe  me, you don’t want it.

BPD is turning nothing into everything, is knowing you’re being irrational and not being able to stop regardless, is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person you’re talking to into having to take care of you when they really don’t want to.

It’s thinking someone doesn’t care about you anymore because they made a new friend. It’s automatically registering new people as a threat. It’s a fear of abandonment and rejection that’s damn near omnipresent. It’s being able to shift from ‘I love you so much!’ to ‘I don’t give a fuck, I hate you, I don’t even want to talk to you’ and back at the drop of a hat.

It’s finding identity in a drastic hair change, and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out. It’s seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are. It’s waking up and trying to be a new person every day. Go vegan, go goth, go hipster, go glamour, cut your hair, change your makeup, gain weight, lose weight, and never feel quite there. Ever.

It’s comprehending ‘love’ as ‘pity’ and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection. It’s regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously NEEDING to get it out. It’s wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someone’s arms because, at least then, they don’t have to clean your wounds for you. They won’t hate you. They won’t be annoyed. 

It’s the constant battle, every time you get upset, of, “Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about? What is more abusive, talking about this or hiding it? If I tell them I’ll bring them down and I’ll guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault. If I don’t, I’m a disgusting liar, I’m manipulative, I’m untrustworthy.”

It’s wondering if you’re faking your symptoms. It’s disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days. It’s feeling like you aren’t real, and then wishing you weren’t. It’s fear, a lack of self, and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times. It’s trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself. It’s feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because, whoops, you’re being manipulative.",2019-11-07 01:03:36,1835,166,None,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/dspuar/the_reality_of_bpd/,False,Letter/Note,top

asl2gr,anxiety,"Professor here, if you have missed class, please come back. We aren’t mad at you.","Hello, I’ve read a lot of posts recently about folks missing classes and feeling too anxious to come back. Don’t worry. We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what’s going on in your lives. I know it’s easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before. Please feel better and know that you are always welcome back into class. Just shoot us an email and let us know what’s up so we can help you make up the work you missed.
